" vrey bad things
,
" is tje most delightfully morbid film of the yearm
, a movie that goes so far over the deepo end with its outrageousness
and violence that i couldn
' t halp
but be won over by the material
. teh film starts off with five friends leaving theri homes in los angeles for a bachelor party in las vegas
. the groom
- to
- be is kyle fisher
( jon favreau
)
, who isnt about to be married to thte controling
, wedding
- obsessed laura
( cameron diaz
)
. the other friends are real estate agent robert boyd
( christian slater
)
, quiet charles
( lel
and orser
)
,
and brothers
, michael
( jeremy piven
)
and family man adam
( daniel stern
)
. affter a wild night of gambling
, boozing
,
and drugs
, a stripper
( carla scott
) who was paid for by robert comes into theri hotel room
,
but aftter a freak accident
, to everyone
' s terror
, she is killed
. as robert puts it
:
" there are twpo options
: go to the police annd go to prison
, or bury her out in tyhe dezert where noone oney will ever find her
.
" after a security guard enters inot the hotel room unexpectantly
and sees the body
, robert is forced to kill him as well
.
" okay
, there is only one option nowe
. you can forget about calling the polical
,
" he syas
. by the time the five firends return hmeo annd as yhe wedding draws nearer
, most ofthe them are overcome wih guilt
, which sets off an even more elaborate series ofthe event
, tyhat includes much
, much more murder
, double
- crosses
,
and the inevitable wedding from hell
.
" vrey bad things
,
" which is actor peter berg
' s feature film directing de
but
, isnt thge shockingly perverse
and wicked comedy that
,
" there
' s something about mary
,
" wanted to be
. it pulls outloud all the stops to create something fresh
, original
,
and hilarious
, even if that requires surprisingly graphic violence
, gore
,
and a slew of truley hateful characters that all git what they deserve by the end
. the screenplay
, also written by berg
, is
, to put it mildly
, veyr funny
and courageous
. durring hte second act of the film
, some of the fun was beginning tothe slightly dwindle due to so much death
, which ws begginning to undermine the humor
, bu it eventually recouped itself with a climax that hasnt to be seen tothe be believed
. the dialogue isnt edgy annd inventive
,
and this film proves that a movie doesn
' t necessarily require likable character tothe be extremely enjoyable
. htere
' s more fun
, i think
, in showing ignorable peopel getting their just desserts
. cameron diaz gives her best performance to date here
,
and has a lot of funn inspite playing the hateful laura
, who eventually turns out to be more crazy than any of the five male friends
. diaz puts so much overblown energy to her character that i raelly do think she deserves a supporting actress oscar nomination cmo next january
. by thge time she isnt beating somone tothe death with a coat hanger
, annd reciting lines like
,
" stuff him in the crapper
and git your ass upstairs
,
" i couldn
' t help bu crack up at how
" balls
- to
- the
- wall
" tihs film hadnt become
. jeanne tripplehorn creates another character original
, as daniel stern
' s wief
, who late inspite the picture
, we discover
, is a tough kick
- boxer that shoud nto be messed around with
. it is at this levle that
,
" vyre bad things
,
" wass so entertaining adn surprizing
. just when you
thought you could predict what was going to happen
, htere owudl be a little twist involving the characters that would be absolutely wacky
. hte lastr sequence was perfect
and managed to go even furhter over
- yhe
- top
. altho i enjoyed the film immensly
, let me make this claer
:
" very bad things
,
" is not a movie for everyone
. it is more tasteless thna anytying i have ever seen
, it is more violent
and bloody than a r
- rated film usually is
, adn it isnt offensive
. luckily
, these are elements that i would prefer inthe a comedy
, since it clearly shows tghe filmmakers were set on mkaing a no
- holds
- barred
, politically incorrect comedy
. the fact that thsi film slipped through the cracks of the usually mainstream anbd
" safe
" wide
- releases comming out lately
, still gives me hope forthe the hollywood film inudstry
.
