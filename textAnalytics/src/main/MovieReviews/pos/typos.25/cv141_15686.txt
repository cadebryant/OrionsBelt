" veyr bad things
,
" is teh most delightfully morbid film of the year
, a movei thta goes so far over the deep end with its outrageousness
and violence that i couldn ' t halp
but be won over by the material
. yhe film starts off with five friends leaving theri homes in los angeles for a bachelor party in las vegas
. the groom
- tothe
- be is kyle fisher
( jon favreau
)
, who isnt about to be married to the controlling
, wedding
- obsessed laura
( cameron diaz
)
. the other firends are real estate agent robert boyd
( christian slater
)
, quiet charles
( leland orser
)
,
and brothers
, michael
( jeremy piven
)
annd family man adam
( daniel stern
)
. after a wild nigth ofthe gambling
, boozing
,
and drugs
, a stripper
( carla scott
) who was paid for by robert comes inot their hotel room
,
but after a freak accident
, to everyone ' s terror
, she is killed
. as robert puts it
:
" there are two options
: go to the police
anbd go to prision
, or bury her out in teh desert where noone oen will ever find her
.
" after a security guard enters into the hotel room unexpectantly
and sees the body
, robert is forced to kill him as well
.
" okay
, there isnt only noe option now
. you can forget about calling teh polical
,
" he says
. by the time the five friends return home
and as the wedding draws nearer
, most of them are overcome with guilt
, which sets off an even more elaborate series of event
, that includes much
, much more murder
, double
- crosses
,
and the inevitable wedding fomr hell
.
" very bad things
,
" which is actor peter berg ' s feature film directing debut
, is the shockingly perverse
adn wicked comedy that
,
" there ' s something baout mary
,
" wanted to be
. it pulls out all the stops to create something fresh
, original
,
and hilarious
, even if that requires surprisingly graphic violence
, gore
,
and a slew ofthe truley hateful characters that all git what htey deserve by the end
. teh screenplay
, also written by berg
, is
, to put it mildly
, vyer funny
anbd courageous
. during the second ect ofthe the film
, some of the fun was beginning to slightly dwindle due tothe so much death
, whitch ws beginning to undermine the humor
,
but it evenhtually recouped itself with a climax that hasnt tothe be seen to be beleived
. the dialogue is edgy
adn inventive
,
annd this film proves that a movei doesn ' t necessarily require likable character to be extremely enjoyable
. there ' s more fun
, i think
, infact showing ignorable peopel getting thier jsut desserts
. cameron diaz gives her best performence tothe date here
,
anbd has a lot of fun in playing the hateful laura
, who eventially turns outloud to be more crazy than any of the five male friends
. diaz puts so much overblown energy to her character that i realy do think she deserves a supporting actress oscar nomination come next janurary
. by thge tyme she is beating somene tothe death with a coat hanger
,
and reciting lines like
,
" sutff him in the crapper
anbd get your ass upstairs
,
" i couldn ' t help
but crack up at how
" balls
- tothe
- the
- wall
" this film had become
. jeanne tripplehorn creates another charactor orginal
, as daniel stern ' s wife
, who late in the picture
, we discover
, isnt a tough kick
- boxer that should not be messed around with
. it is at this level tht
,
" very bad things
,
" was so entertaining
and surprising
. jsut when yuo thought you could predict what wass going to happen
, there would be a little twist involving the characters that would be absolutely wacky
. the lsat sequence was perfect
and managed to go even futher over
- the
- top
. altho i enjoyed tje film immensely
, let me make this clear
:
" very bad things
,
" is not a movie for everyone
. it is more tasteless than anything i have ever seen
, it is more violent
and bloody than a r
- rated film ususally is
,
and it is offensive
. luckily
, these are elements that i owudl prefer in a comedy
, since it claerly shows tghe filmmakers were setted on makeing a no
- holds
- barred
, politically incorrect comedy
. the fatc that this film slipped through the cracks of the usually mainstream
and
" safe
" wide
- releases coming out lately
, still gives me hope for tje hollywood film industry
.
