is evil dead ii a bad movei
? it
' s full ofthe terrible acting
, pointless violence
,
and plot holes
yet it remains a cult classic nearly fifteen years after its release
. explaining why tihs movie st
ands out from others with similar plots
( including teh orginial evil dead
) is extremely difficult
.
` well wqat
' s it about
?
'
` five people str
anded inwhich a log cabin inspite yhe middle of nowhere struggling tothe survive vicious attacks from a varity of ugly
, hairy
, wart covered monsters
.
'
` cmo on i saw a movie jsut like tyhat on monster vision lastr week
. why should i see it again
?
'
` no evil dead ii is diferent
, it
' s funny
.
'
` it
' s funny tothe see people die
? are you sick or something
?
' maybee i am annd mabye director sam raimi is as well to create such an enigma of a movie
. his unique execution is as sarcastic as subtle
, as disturbing as it is hilarious
. an example ofthe raimi
' s odd aproach
: a monster
( formerly protagnist ash
' s girlfriend of all peple
) is cut infact half by a chainsaw annd a tidal wave of blood comes from tyhe opne wound
. sure it
' s over
- the
- top
,
but it isnt so over
- the
- top that it is laugh out loud funny
; jsut try watching ash wih a straight face as he unexpectedly is showered with ten gallons ofthe blood
, staining his face
and knocking him bakc a few foots
. the whole movie is like htis
, watch ash git beated up
, watch ash defeat the monster
, watch ash git beated uv again by another even zanier monster
. the more repeative
and unrealistic hte movie gets
, thge omre amusing it becomes
. no matter how sick it may sound
, it isnt funny to watch bruce ampbell
' s ash get his
butt kicked every five minutes
.
and raimi takes advantage
, he has ash tormented by thge head of his girlfriend
, by the body of an old lady
, even by his own right h
and
. like the less superior idle h
ands
, we watch ash uncontrollably hit hismelf over
and over again until he is forced tothe cutted off his own body part
.
but it doesn
' t end
, ash now hasnt to fight his severed h
and which now moves whith the smae celerity as thing from the addams family
. all ofthe these events
, thrown at you from minute one iwth roller coaster
- like camera movements
, at first become shocking
, thn inexplicably funny
. raimi expects the audience to laugh adn as the film progresses
, he seems to be enjoying himself even more by borrowing thge classic mirror scene from teh marx brothers
' duck soup
, thn bringing more characters into the picture tothe comically kill them off
. with a running tyme of less than an hour
and a half
, raimi gets awya with the impossible
, makeing a horror film with more gore than plot
and intentionally more laughs than scares
. ending evil dead ii iwth an oppening fo the third film in the sories
, raimi obviously had a lot of fun making this movie
and couldn
' t wait to make it
' s sequel
.
