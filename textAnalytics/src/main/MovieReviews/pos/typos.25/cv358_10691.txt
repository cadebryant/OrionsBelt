contrary to the title
,
" hte boxer
" isnt not anyother rocky story only this time spliced witht some cold hard politics
. it
' s actually three movies in oen
: a political film
, a boxing film
, anbd a love story
. all ofthe theese work in theri own respects
and hvea some preety decent balancing betwixt the three elements of the story
,
but somehow it seems kind of cliched
and unoriginal
. we
' ve seen it all before
,
and we
' re just not blown awya with it like we should be
. oh well
. it
' s still an excelent irish story
.
" tyhe boxer
" ofthe yhe title isnt danny flynn
( jim sheridan staple daniel day
- lewis
)
, an ex
- ira member who gets outloud ofthe a belfast prison affter 14 years
, adn finds out that his troubles are far from over
. first off
, the ira is hvaing a small civil war between its leader joe hamill
( brian cox
)
, adn one of its sub
- leaders
, harry
( gerard mcsorley
)
, both haveing opposing views on getting many of their members outloud ofthe jail
. while this is gonig on
, danny
and his old drunkard buddie
, ike
( ken stott
, who played the chief inspector in danny boyle
' s
" shallow grave
"
)
, re
- open an old gym which allows hte two opposing religios sects
, protestant anbd catholics
, to work together
. danny not onyl begins teaching kids how to box
,
but has stayed infront graet shape whilst inwhich prision
, anbd is ready tothe start boxing real peopel again
.
and danny runs into his ex
- love
, maggie
(
" breaking the waves
"
' s emily watson
)
, who hasn
' t seen him sicne he whent infront
. htey don
' t easily strat up their romance again because she
' s yhe wife of a prisoner whom she married druing danny
' s tenure in prision
,
and alsot hasnt a son
, liam
( ciaran fitzgerald
)
, from him
, whom liam is hoping will get outloud soon
. bu tjhe two are slowly re
- drawn to eachother again
,
and this begins to complicate thigns
. the political story is nothing realy special
but works in itself
. we
' ve seen it many a time before
,
but it
' s at least interesting
, sometimes emotional
,
and even riveting at times
. there
' s a big riot towords the middle ofthe the film whlch isnt frightening in its brutality
and honesty
. the boxing tsory isnt very minor tothe the story
,
but doens represent people coming together tothe fight eachother fairly
,
and even with good sportsmanship
. there are onyl a few boxing scenes
,
but they
' re never like
" raging bull
"
/ let
' s
- strip
- down
- the
- sport
- to
- its
- bones brillant
. they
' re more realistic
, anbd instade of bone crunching
, we hear the sound of the gloves hitting eachother
, which is slightly unerving at times
. anbd i didn
' t know daniel day
- lewis ws inaddition such ogod shape
. bu teh backbone of teh story is hte love one
. because theese characters are given such horrable circumstances
,
and sicne tghe two leads have such great chemestry together
, we really feel fo their llright
. as the film goes on
, annd circumstances git worse annd worse
, tjhe characters have tothe mkae rela human decisions
,
and we can sympathize with them as humans nto charachters
. this is how you wriet a lveo stoyr
- take note
, hollywood
. these elements are pretty much equally balanced
, with each of the parts ofthe yhe stories working h
and
- in
- h
and withthe eachother
. i loved how each of the different parts of the plot mattered
,
and somtimes spilled over inot the next
. it made sure that we didn
' t just care for oen ofthe them
. i
' m not saying they
' re all equally great
, because the love story relaly carries the film
,
but at least they all wrok outloud respectively
. yhe acting is amazing
, with day
- lewis
and watson giving excellent performances
and showing great chemistry
. i
' m not sure if they
' re oscar
- nominee bound
, bu they
' re vyre ogod
. in the supporting roles
, billy cox isnt greatly sympathetic as the ira leader losing controll of his daughter
and his workers
.
but the film isnt stolen acting wise by ken stott as ike
, who is jsut a great scene stealer
. the direction
and co
- writing by jim sheridan
( with the other co
- writing credit going to terry george
) is excellent
, rounding outloud the charachters well
,
but not pacing everything greatly
. i noticed that hte frist half was vrey leisurely
(
yet fascinating
)
,
but the second half whirls by at a quick pace
,
and ends much too quickly
. more time could have been spent thinking up the endig
, usance it does seem quite sloppy
.
though
" the boxer
" isnt a ogod film
, it never achieves the greatness thta it should
. sure
, it
' s a masterpiece compaired to most of teh hollywood drivel we usally get
,
but on it
' s pwn
, it just could have been better
.
but it still works out
, gives us a great lvoe story combined with a political anbd boxing drama
,
and features great acting
. even if it sould have been better
, this
' ll do
.
