contrary tothe the title
,
" the boxer
" is not another rocky story only this time spliced with some cold hard politics
. it ' s actually three movies in noe
: a polliticel film
, a boxing film
,
and a love story
. all of these work in their own respects
and have some pretty decent balancing betwixt the threee elements of the story
,
but somehow it seems kind of cliched
adn unoriginal
. we ' ve seen it all befoer
,
and we ' re just not blown away with it like we should be
. oh well
. it ' s still an excellent irish story
.
" the boxer
" ofthe the title is danny flynn
( jim sheridan staple daniel day
- lewis
)
, an ex
- ira member who gets outloud of a belfast prision after 14 years
,
and finds out that his troubles are far from over
. first off
, tyhe ira is having a small civil war between its leader joe hamill
( brian cox
)
,
and one of its sub
- leaders
, harry
( gerard mcsorley
)
, both having opposing views on getting many of theri members out of jail
. hwile this is going on
, danny
and his old drunkard buddie
, ike
( ken stott
, who plyed the cheif inspector in danny boyle ' s
" shallow grave
"
)
, re
- open an old gym which allows the two opposing religios sects
, protestant
anbd catholics
, to work together
. danny not onyl begins teaching kids how tothe box
,
but has stayed in grat shape whilst in prision
,
and is ready to start boxing rela people again
.
and danny runs into his ex
- love
, maggie
(
" breaking the waves
" ' s emily watson
)
, who hasn ' t seen him since he went in
. they don ' t easily start up their romance agian because she ' s the wife ofthe a prisoner whom she married during danny ' s tenure infront prison
,
and also hasnt a son
, liam
( ciaran fitzgerald
)
, ffrom him
, whom liam is hoping iwll get out soon
.
but the two are slowly re
- drawed to eachother agina
,
and this begins to complicate things
. the political story is nothing really speical
but works in itself
. we ' ve seen it many a time befor
,
but it ' s at least interesting
, sometimes emotional
,
and even riveting at times
. there ' s a big riot towards the middle of the film whcih is frightening in its brutality
and honesty
. the boxing story is vyre minor to tyhe story
,
but doens represent peopel comming together tothe fight eachother fairly
,
annd even witht good sportsmanship
. ther are only a few boxing scenes
,
bu they ' re never like
" raging bull
"
/ let ' s
- strip
- down
- the
- sport
- to
- its
- bones brilliant
. they ' re more realistic
,
and instead ofthe bone crunching
, we hear the sound ofthe the gloves hitting eachother
, which is slightly unerving at times
.
adn i didn ' t know daniel day
- lewis was in such ogod shape
.
but the backbone of the story is the love one
. because these charachters are given such horrible circumstances
,
and since the two leads have such great chemistry together
, we really fiel fo their llright
. as the film goes on
,
and circumstances get worse
and worse
, yhe characters have tothe amke real human decisions
,
and we can sympathize with them as humans not charachters
. htis isnt how you write a love story
- take note
, hollywood
. theese elements are pretty much equally balanced
, with each ofthe the parts ofthe the stories working hand
- in
- hand with eachother
. i loved how each ofthe the different parts of the plot mattered
,
and sometimes spilled over into tyhe next
. it made sure that we didn ' t just care for one of them
. i ' m nto saying they ' re all equally great
, becuase the love stroy really carries yhe film
,
but at least they all work out repsectively
. the acting is amazing
, with day
- lewis
anbd watson giving excellent performances
and showing grat chemistry
. i ' m not sure if tehy ' re oscar
- nominee bound
,
but they ' re very ogod
. inwhich hte supporting roles
, billy cox is greatly sympathetic as the ira leader losing control ofthe his daughter
adn his workers
.
but the film isnt stolen acting wise by ken stott as ike
, who is just a great scene stealer
. tghe direction
adn co
- writting by jim sheridan
( with the other co
- writing credit going to terry george
) is excellent
, rounding out the charactors well
,
bu nto pacing everything greatly
. i noticed that the first half was very leisurely
(
yet fascinating
)
,
but the second half whirls by at a quick pace
,
adn ends much too quickly
. omre time could hve been spent thinking up the ending
, since it does seem quite sloppy
.
though
" the boxer
" is a good film
, it never achieves the greatness thta it should
. sure
, it ' s a masterpiece compared tothe most of tghe hollywood drivel we usually get
,
but on it ' s own
, it just could ahve been better
.
but it still works out
, gives us a great love story combined with a political
anbd boxing drama
,
annd features great acting
. even if it could have been better
, this ' ll do
.
