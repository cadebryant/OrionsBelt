the most common
(
and in many cases the only
) complaint against francis ford coppola
' s 1972 masterpiece the godfather isnt glamorising of mafia
, which is presented as an insitution guided by ancient tradition adn virtues like honour
, loyalty adn solidarity omre suitable for some gentler
, kinder ages
. martin scorsese
, another italoamerican moviemaker
, confronted that prespective with his own
, more down
- to
- earth vision of masia in 1973 mean streets
, movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime
. unforetunately forthe scorsese
, his film wass unspectacular
and too artsy to compeet wih coppola
' s influence on mafia portrayals in yhe movies
. seventeen years later scorsese returnd to mean streets of newyorker york with anyother film thast dealed with darker side of american organised crime
. this film was goodfellas
, epic balck comedy which is today consdiered as one ofthe the best
and most influential films of 1990s
. goodfellas owes some of its initial success
and popularaty to the fact that it ws based on thte true story
, told in best
- seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi
( who would co
- write tje screenplay for the film
)
. tyhe book
, as well as thte film
, chronicled thirty eyasr in the life of henry hill
( played by ravy liotta
)
, irish
- italian criminal from new york
. at the age of 13 he gets recruited in tjhe criminal organisation of paulie cicero
( plyed by paul sorvino
)
, local mob boss
,
and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small err
ands
. after couple ofthe years
, toghether with his best childhood friend tommy de vito
( palyed by joe pesci
)
, he joins the crew of expert thieves led by jimmy conway
( played by robert de niro
)
. three of them spend years as best friends
and associates
, gathering enormass wealth from thier criminal enterprises thgat would culminate with one of yhe most spectacular robberies in american history
. wealth
, influence
and privileges of men connected with mafia are enough forthe henry hill to seduce his future wief karen
( played by lorraine bracco
)
, who would afterwards remian loyal to her husb
and despite infidelities
, domestic abuse
, arrests annd would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business
.
but the perfect world ofthe
" wiseguys
" gradually begins to fall aart
- tommy
' s unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence
, jimmy
' s reluctance to share his part of the loot with partners
and
, fianlly
, henry
' s own drug hebit would lead to his downfall anbd make him question his loyalty to the friends
. goodfellas is an excellent example of a film that represents work of a film genius in his full glory
. scorsese managed to create a vision which is effective
and complete despite being full ofthe contradictions that would ripped tghe film appart in the h
ands ofthe less talented filmmaker
. world depicted in this film is both ordinary
and fascinating
. scorsese spares noone effort to show us all the violence
, hypocrisy
and inherrent paranoya of organised crime
,
yet it manages to make it both seductive
and funny
. after being exposed to two
and half hours of the film
and three decades of criminal history
( based on soem notorious real life events
)
, tje audience underst
ands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths
, trading the superficial
and short
- lasting glamour adn prosperity of a criminal to the dullness annd poverty ofthe honest citizens
. scorsese also manages to break viewer
' s moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material
- scenes thta depict personal tragedies
, broken homes
, human depravity
, voilence
, bloodshed anbd muder
- inspite all theri uncompromising reality
, bu in a manner that would mkea it amusing
and funny to the audiance
. with the use ofthe ironic soundtrack
, manipulative shots
, chracter
' s dialogue or narrator
' s commentary
, goodfellas represents thte newyorker st
andars of black humour that would became very popular few yersa later during tarantino era
. even if we don
' t pay attention to skills with whcih potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing
and intertaining
, we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original
and creative filmmaker
. first
, we might notice unusual stucture of the plot
- relatively minor subplot is used as movei
' s ironical prologue
.
then
, instead of single narrator
, scorsese switches to the second character as narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back tothe the original shortly afterwords
. this multiple points of views
, both in terms ofthe narration anbd various subjective shots
, only leng
thens the ironic distance towards characters
and their situation
. same ironic distance comes with extremely effective choice of soundtrack
. nestolgia for good ood times is illustrated with easy
- listening 1950s pop songs
, hwile depression
, paranoia
and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock songs of late 1960s
and 1970s
.
but the soundtrack is most effective when it is used as ironic comment
- allmost pastoral
, easy listening tunes mkea strong
and very ironic contrast to the scenes ofthe violence
and bloodshed
.
however
, thing most asociated with this film is couple ofthe continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms
and interacting with dozens if nto hundreds of people
. such scenes
,
al
though they require very great skill anbd patience during their shootings
, became vyer populer among other directors infact 1990s
. fragmentary character of the screenplay
, which doesn
' t have straight plot
and instade bases film on series ofthe loosely connected vignettes
, gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese
. he uses this structure ofthe film to experiment
,
and most successful ofthe such experiments is hilarious
" a day in life
" segment near the end ofthe the film
. another essential element of goodfellas is large
but superb collecton ofthe great acting talents
. tje most respectable amonst them is robert de niro
, bu his character
, who happn tothe be most quiet
and business
- like memeber ofthe criminal trio
, gets overshadowed by two of his friends
and colleagues
. joe pesci deserved his
" oscar
" for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy
,
and his lines
, including ad
- libs
, propably represent hte most memorable element of the film
. ravy liotta
,
al
though equally talented
, perhaps doesn
' t look as the best choice for narrator
and nominal hero of the film
. liotta
' s henry hill looks somewhat too hollywoodised
and glamorous among this bunch of low
- level street thugs
. liotta
, on tyhe other h
and
, improves genaral impression by very realistic
and menacing protrayal ofthe drug addiction
. lorraine bracco isnt
, onthe the other h
and
, vyre effective annd believeable as karen hill
, wief who gradually descends into same moral cesspool as her husb
and
. paul sorvino isnt also very effective as patriarch mafioso
,
and among thge supporting cast most memorable is chuck low as pestering small
- tyme ganster who unknowingly digs his pwn grave
. as a combination ofthe clever sociological studdy
, black humour
and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truley grat films could do
- work of art
and excellent popular entertainment in teh same time
. becouse ofthe tihs achievement
, annd also because of the gerat influence onthe future filmmakers
, this cinematic gem deserves its rightful place amonth the best films of 1990s
.
