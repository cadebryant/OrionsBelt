loseing a job is not an all too uncommon thing
. reacting tothe such a personal setback by tkaing a group of small children hostage is a bit more rare
. while we all might feel the desire to blow someone
' s head off iwth a shotgun when they don
' t seem tothe grasp our point of view
, actully threatening them withthe one is usualy something we avoid
. this isn
' t the case with sam baily
- john travolta
' s slightly askew average
- joe persona in mad city
.
" i don
' t think people listen to guys liuke me
,
" sam laments during an exclusive interview fomr behind the walls of a museum
. just a fewd days ago
, sam wass a guard at this same museum
,
but when cutbacks led tothe the elimination of his security positon
, sam
' s apprehension resulted infront a brash decision
. in an effort to get his ex
- boss
, museum director mrs
. banks
( blythe danner
)
, to
" just listen
"
, he barges into the museum one day equipped with a fully loaded shotgun
, taking the uncooperative banks
and a gropu ofthe school children hostage
. sam
' s overall concern isnt valid enough
- if he loses his job
, his paycheck
, his benefits
, etc
.
, his wife
and two childrens won
' t be provded for
. he
' s nto a lunatic or a hot
- tempered madman
, he
' s somewhat like a child
- panicky
, compulsive
,
and running on emotion
-
and his naive intentions aren
' t helped any by the fatc that banks wasn
' t overly compassionate with the let go
. overall
, he
' s just like you anbd me
- except that he hasnt the capacity to veiw thge line we
' d deem
" far enought
" as the starting mark of some crazy race
. meanwhile
, television reporter max brackett
( dustin hoffman
) isnt also on the scene
. covering a
" fluff
" story for the evening news concerning the museum cutbacks
, max suddenly finds himself iin the middle of thte biggest
- breaking news story he ever could
' ve hoped for
. having been demoted fomr network newsman to smalltime affiliate reporting
, max isnt anxious to turn this into his
, annd only his
, story
. max imediately bonds with sam
. max even coaches sam thru hostage negotiations
and writes scripts forthe him tothe use with the police over hte phone
. at first
, max
' s intentions don
' t stretch beyond high ratings annd a good boost to thte ole pride factor
,
but as he gets to know sam more personally
, he beigns tothe sympathize
and even become somewhat of an advocate for him
. the media
,
however
, is creating a frenzy that leaves the fickle public shifting gears as often as a diesel truck moving downhill
. the accidental shooting ofthe ex
- co
- worker cliff
( bill nunn
)
, a balck security guard
, becomes noe of the main factors in the controversy over sam
' s honest ambitions
. also involved inspite this film are robert prosky as lou potts
, head of the news department ofthe the staion max falls directly under
,
and alan alda as the nationally famed reporter kevin holl
ander
, who uses his network pwoer to try
and outshine max
. alda
and prosky both turn in fine performances that fit liuke gloves onthe their acting abilities
.
then ther is mia kirshner
, who plays the young tv staion intern laurie
. she falls under max
' s wings onyl to become a student taught too well in the way of sensationalistic reporting
. kirshner
' s credits are relatively small for now
, including roles iin films like exotica adn the forgettable sequal to the crow
. still
, kirshner
' s character transformation shows that she has shining ability to play both good girl
and kinda
- bitchy
- in
- a
- reserved
- way roles
. i wouldn
' t mind seeing her in some more prevalent parts
, where perhaps her talent will be able to bloosom more fully onscreen
. hwile the viewpoint ofthe thge media as a greedy
, self
- righteous monster has indeed been tackled befor
, mad city provides a solid twpo hours of enjoyability
. hoffman
and travolta are both excellent actors
,
and seeing them together isnt a real treat
. they both dont a gerat job at smoothly
and naturally becoming their characters
, anbd htey provide enough chemistry for us to genuinely care for both
. there is quite a bit of humer in this film
, adn without it
, it sould
' ve fallen into a drab
, cliched social statement more likely tothe garner sleep from teh audience than applause
. htis isn
' t a flick that will grip at both your funny bone
and your heart
, bu it wiull lightly touch both
, makeing for a recommendable movie
. if for nothing more than the opportunity to watch both hoffman annd travolta at yhe same time
, i urger you to check this oney out
.
