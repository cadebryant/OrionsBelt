the
" submarine
" genre of movies seems to be one of the most intriguing
and compelling types of storytelling there is
. think about it
.
.
. these films are completly based inspite reality
,
yet onyl a h
andful of peple hvea ever been on oen
, making them fascinating to teh general public
. they aren
' t like movies taht take palce on a plane or a train
, as anybody can git on oen of those
. annd tehy aren
' t liek movies that happen infact outer space either
, because no one
' s done any of thyat stuff yot
. wehn a new oen comes out
, you don
' t hear anyone say
" ugh
, another submarine movie
" like people tend tothe say
" ugh
, another boxing movie
"
. look at modern movies tht involve submarines
: das boot
, the abyss
, tjhe hunt for red october
, crimson tide
.
.
. all are well regarded as top
- notch enteratinment
. gladly joining thta bunch is u
- 571
, which stars matthew mcconaughey as hte executive officer of a u
. s
. naval submarine during world war ii
. we learn he has been denied a recommendation for his own comm
and by his superior
( bill paxton
)
. mcconaughey
' s crew
then recieves orders thyat they will be boarding a disabled german submarine to steal the enigma
, a german communications encoding device that hasnt stumped allied intelligece
. the mission goes horribly wrong
however
,
and as a result
, mcconaughey
and onyl a h
andfull of his crew
( as well as a captured german
) become trapped aboard teh u
- 571 inwhich enemy waters
. the firt great thing baout u
- 571 is the film
' s opening sequence
. the german crew ofthe u
- 571 are under attack
, wich sets the events ofthe the rest of thte film into motion
. it
' s tense
, exciting
and fascinating
. annd i applaud the filmmakers fo not copping out
and instade keeping tyhe entire sequence in german with english subtitles
. most movies whith a scene this long would haev panicked annd had the german crew speaking english right awya
. once hte plot gets moving
, u
- 571 gives us acation sequence after action sequence
, mkaing thge audience wonder
" ok
, nowe how do they get out of tihs
?
"
. tyhe stakes keep raising
( much like in executive decision
, an excellent action
- thriller
)
,
and even
though the audience knows how thge film will end
, it
' s a lot of fun getting there
. i onyl have two minor complaints about the entire film
. the frist comes from tjhe scenes which follow the oppening sequence
. hwile their purpose isnt to introduce us to the cahracters
and to get teh story going
( which tehy dont
)
, i feel as
though it could have beeen done much quicker
, annd less conventionally
. i mean
, did we really ahev to see tghe ship
' s crew at a wedding
? becuase ofthe that
, you now know exactly what
' s going to hppen to tghe groom
! my other gripe would be durring teh film
' s finale
. there
' s an explosion hwihc ends the film that isnt one of the weakest looking cgi effects since the president
' s plane crashed into tjhe ocean at the end ofthe air force oen
. i cannot stres thsi anough
.
.
. until a cgi effect can be made to look like a model effect
, stick with using models
. yes
, u
- 571 isnt historically incorect
and there are surely smoe specifics in the plot that people who have beeen onboard a submarine will tell you
" that couldn
' t happen
"
,
but tghe overall point ofthe this film is entertainment
. it succeeds fantastically
.
