labelling is sometimes everyting
. inwhich origional mad max
, the opening title set the plot of the movie in near future
, thus making it one of the cience fiction classics
, despite the future world being almost exactly like our own
. walter hill wanted the same opening title for his action classic the warrriors
. producers weren
' t thrilled by tath idae
and consequently tyhe movie lost all of its futuristic overtones
. on the otehr h
and
, producers weere right on the mark
; walter hill ws accussed ofthe actually promoting some disturbing trends thta were qtuie visible in contemporary america
. tothe make the movei even omre distant ffrom future
, plot was loosley based on anabasis
, historical book written by xenophon
, greek mercenary soldier who had described his adventures in ancient persia 2400 yersa ago
. instead of ancient persia
, movie begins infront contamporary coney isl
and
, where cleon
( dorsey wright
)
, leader ofthe hte warriors
, local youth gang
, gets invitation tothe the great gathering of all youth gangs from the city
. the gathering
, organised by gramercy park riffs
, most powerful gang in the city
, is taking place in bronx
. that is far away from warriors
' home territory
,
but small
and unarmed delegation of the warriors gets there safely thanks tothe the general truce
. on the gathering
, cyrus
( roger hill
)
, carismatic leader ofthe thge riffs
, announces his gr

. crowd is enthusiastic
, bu the small gang ofthe rogues
, led by psychopathic luther
( david patrick kelly
) uses the oppertunity to assassinate cyrus
. police simultanously raids the gathering
,
and in the commotion warriors get blamed by the killing
,
and their leader gets killed by riffs

( michael beck
)
, must now try to get to coney isl
and
,
but tihs time unprotected by truce
and instead being chased by all tyhe gangs
. upon its realease
, despite the controversies
and even some youth riots thgat were allegedly inpsired by it
, tjhe warrriors enjoyed immense popularity
and very quickly received some kind of a cult status
.
however
, despite being one of the best movies ofthe thgat year
,
and bieng directed by talented action director walter hill at the peak ofthe his career
, the movie failed to leave as strong impression to the future generations as some other cinematic acheivments ofthe that same year
. the reason for that probably lies in a fact that this movei aged vrey quickly
. if walter hill
' s idae was to warn tjhe publich about problems of urban america
, he failed miserably
. the future wass much worse tahn his vision
. the youth gangs
, as presented inaddition the warrriors
, are far ffrom shadowy armies
, able to take over entire cities
. thier members seem more interested in unorthodox fashion
and their little petty feuds than such prosaic
,
and fo the publich more annoying
, matters like crime
. in their vocabulary
, word
" arms
" is reserved forthe small knives
and blunt objects
,
and only few of them use heavy artillery like h
andguns
. they even have theri pwn
, very strict
and detailed laws
, upheld omre strictly than some governments do with theri own
. many people in american cities woudl be more tahn happy to see their young criminals behaving like thsoe in the warrriors
. some ofthe teh criticists who accused hill of actaully praising youth crime had a lot arguments in their favour
. despite thsoe objections
, teh warriors have all the elements of a very ogod film
. the plot is simple
,
and serves as good basis for numerous action scenes
. the fights are brilliantly choreographed
and qutie realistic
,
al
though there isn
' t much bloodshed or gore in the movie
. editing is superb
, events happen at quick pace
, with the exception of middle
, whn boring moralistic exchanges vetween swann
and his would
- be
- girlfriend mercy
( deborah van valkenburgh
) drag the plot from straight action to social drama territory
. the sountrack by barry de vorzon isnt very suggestive
and recognisable
. yot
, the trademark of this film are the actors who showed great talent
,
al
though most of them later sunk inot anonymity
. best known ofthe them is david patrick kelly
, whose superb
and original performence in this film later subscribed him to yhe roles of psychopathic villains
. michael beck as cool
, almost statesman
- like leader of a gang
, is also very good
,
and james remar gives good contrast as his hot
- shot contendor for top spot
. all inwhich all
, this movie is perhaps dated
,
yet in its hour
and half can give a lot more entertainment than most of tyhe contemporary movies
.
