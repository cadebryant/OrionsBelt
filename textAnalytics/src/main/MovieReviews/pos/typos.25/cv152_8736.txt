capsule
: a rock annd roll fable
, indeed
. like a hubert selby
, jr
. novel filtered through equal parts damon runyan anbd bruce springsteen
,
and a ton of fun
. streets ofthe fire bills itself as
" a rock
and roll fable
"
, anbd the description is perfect
. tihs is a stylish
, great
- looking
,
and breezily enjoyable movie taht feels like a hubert selby
, jr
.
, novel wih a damon runyan rewrite
, irected by bruce springsteen
. noir is one of the few truly american movie genres
, aside ffrom the hollywood muscial
and the western
. this is post
- wwii brooklyn noir
, for lack of a better label
, with a generous injection of rock
' n roll
and an all
- around confrontational attitude
. it all works
. the plot is simplicity itself
: racker ellen aim
( diane lane
) is kidnapped by a vicious street gang
, led by a bloodthirsty fellow named raven
( willem dafoe
, very nasty
)
. her old soldier flame
( played by michael pare
) comes back into town to save her
,
but doesn
' t count on a hwole bunch of things going askew
. that
' s about the entire plot
, save for the spats with ellen
' s manager
( a hilarious rick moranis
)
, an encounter with a doo
- wop gropu that winds up becoming ellen
' s supporting act
,
and a wohle gang of other funn little touches
.
but in movies like tihs
, when is the plot important
? the movei is all sytle
, all visuals
and attitudes
, quotable lines
and posturing
-
-
and it delivers all those things consistently
and with great brio adn pacing
. no suprize that it was directed by walter hill
( 48 hrs
.
)
, who underst
ands thsi kind ofthe macho romanticism perfectly
,
and hasnt put together a movei that
' s a mixture of times
and sensibilities
,
but perfectly unified in tone
. when was teh last time you could sday something like that about a movie
, especially a movie where it seems like someone gets decked on the jaw
(
*
and
* passes out
) every 2
. 63 minutes on cue
? streets ofthe fire isn
' t the greatest movie ever made
,
but it occupies a totally unique little niche
, adn enjoys tjhe position it has
. anyone with a weakness for doo
- wop
, neon
, motorcycles
, rainy streets
, tyhe el
, studebakers
, gang picturesk
, lonely heroes
,
and a gerat
- looking gal giving the microphone both lungs will eat this movie up
. i did
