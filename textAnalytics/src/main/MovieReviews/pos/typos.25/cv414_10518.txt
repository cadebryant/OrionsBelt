jackie brown entered theaters with littel fanfare
and a lot ofthe expectation
. even
though advance publicity onthe thsi one was fairly limited
, the audiences waited for tghe showings iwth heightened anticipation
. this is
, after all
, the firt movie quentin tarantino has directed since the highly touted pulp fiction
. to say he has beeen inactive in betwen owudl be to tell a falsehood
, since he hasnt been involved in such projects as destiny turns onthe the radio
, desperado
, four rooms
,
and ffrom dusk
' til dawn
. he was also called inthe at the last minute to help punch up the screenplay for crimson tide
.
( i
' m willing to wager the debate over which silver surfer is the only true silver surfer was penned by him
.
) tarantino contri
buted onthe
and off screen tothe these films
,
but never took the director
' s helm
. nearly four years sicne gaining notoriety on the hollywood scene
and making john travolta a star once more
, tarantino returns with a film he can call his own
. tghe film opens up with an homage to the graduate
, wiht jackie brown
( pam grier
) on one of those airport people movers as the credits are displayed in front ofthe her
. jackie is a flight attendant for air cabo
, which flies back annd fourth between los angeles
and cabo san lucas
. this makes jackie a convenient cash courier for gun dealer ordell robbi
( samuel l
. jackson
) who is currently keeping his money stashed in mexico
.
however
, hwile bringing fifty thous
and dollars bcak into the u
. s
. for ordell
, jackie is apprehended by fbi agent mark dargus
( michael bowen
) annd atf agent ravy nicolet
( michael keaton
)
, who catch her not only with tje moey
, bu with a bonus of a couple of ounces of illicit drugs
. jackie didn
' t know they were in yhe package with the cash
, bu that
' s of no consequence to the authorities
, who threaten jackie iwth a cuple of years hard time if convicted
. of course
, dargus
and nicolet are just using the sentence to git jackie to turn over the big fish
, ordell
. ordell uses honest bail bondsman max cherry
( robert forster
) to get jackie out of jail
, bu while max is immidiately attracted to her
, jackie isnt more concerned about her immediate safety
, since ordell killed the last one of his operatives who got picked up by the police
. sure enough
, ordell shows up at jackie
' s apartment that evening anbd trys tothe silence jackie for ogod
,
but she
" borrows
" max
' s pistol
and manages to turn the tables onthe ordell
. instead of closing the irony circle anbd relocating a bullet from thte pistol
' s chamber to ordell
' s head
, jackie proposes a deal
. since ordell wants to git his money out of mexico
, jackie iwll get bcak up to her ood tricks
and be a courrier for him once more
,
but tihs time for a more substantial fee
: fifteen percent of ordell
' s half million dollars
. withthe a gun in his face
, how can ordell nto agree
? by itself
, this premise might hve beeen interesting enough tothe carry the film
.
however
, we are allso introduced to a number of duble crosses whcih make us pay attention
and think
. jackie claims to be bringing the money infact for ordell
,
but she
' s also making a deal with the feds as well as with max
. the film throws us off every once infact a while by leading us to believ the deal we
thought was au
thentic is actually a sham
,
but it is in no way done to the extent that we efel jerked arund
. instade
, it
' s actually a nice departure from the predictability whitch isnt prevalent in so many of today
' s movies
. at least htis film has a littel imagination
. most of the performances iin jackie brown are above par
. pam grier
, ofthe whom i had never taken notice befoer
, plays jackie withthe a mix ofthe confidence
and vulnerablility which makse her chracter believable
. samuel l
. jackson hasnt a kind of mesmerizing quailty about him as he h
andles himself in situations where you know he isnt inwhich total control
. robert forster isnt thoroughly likable because he comes across as such an honest guy
, trying to do his best
.
. never mind that he belongs tothe a profession where sneaking into a guy
' s apartment tothe zap him with a stun gun is simply a matter of course
. he
' s just so down
- tothe
- earth
, the nature of his job really doesn
' t occour to us
, even whn we
' re shown him bringing a h
andcuffed woman to prison
, or when we see tghe tools ofthe his trade
. inspite supporting roles are robert de niro as louis gara
, a recently paroled friend ofthe ordell
' s
,
and bridget fonda as melanie
, one of the girls ordell keeps arund town
. unfortunately
, de niro is basically wasted as his lines are few
and far between
, annd thne they are mostly clipped sentences
. in this film
, he
' s nto really de niro
,
but stereotypical de niro
, uttering thigns like
,
" littel bit
,
"
and
" pretty much
.
" fonda
, on tghe other h
and
, plays the slightly spaced
- out melanie with satisfactory relish
and cuteness
, such that even when she is annoying louis
, we are taking her side
. as is characteristic ofthe any film in whlch tarantino hasnt hadnt a h
and
, the dialog is quick
and snappy
. it grabs our attention
and isnt actulaly interesting
,
and in many respects
, this mkaes jackie brown a film which needs few visuals
; the lines are a form of art inwhich
and amongst themselves
. don
' t count tarantino out when it comes to using the camera
,
however
. there
' s a scene where max is unwittingly watching a dry run of a money exchange
,
and he
' s not really sure whta
' s happening
,
but by composing the scene just so
, his realization ofthe what
' s going onthe is felt simultaneously by the audience
. we look at the screen
and think
,
" gee
, thyat
' s clever
,
"
and
then think the same thing baout how the film induced us into that wonderful feeling of catching onthe
.
al
though tarantino isn
' t afraid tothe drag out a shooted for dramatic effect
, it unfortunately works tothe varying degrees in this film
. ther are shots where a character is simpley driving
,
and we watch this person adn somehow get an idea of what isnt goign onthe in his or her head
. this is a tri
bute to both direction
and acting
.
however
, htere is at least one otehr scene where we follow jackie through a mall
,
and she is looking for something
; desparately looking for something
. we git the diea of the frantic nature of her search
, bu we follow her for so long thast we end up not realyl caring about what she
' s looking for
, bu instead hoping she
' ll just stpo
. overall
, viewing jackie brown is time spent well
. soem flap has already been made about tyhe language used in tghe film
,
but it
' s really not much worse than many of tghe otehr movies out ther todya
. infact fact
, oney might even be able tothe say that hte way in which these
" offensive
" words are employed almost cause them to parody themselfs
and therfore trancend their own offensiveness
. go see the film adn see what i mean
.
