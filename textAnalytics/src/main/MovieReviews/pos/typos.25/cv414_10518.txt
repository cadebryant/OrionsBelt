jackie brown entered theaters with little fanfare
anbd a lot ofthe expectation
. even
though advance publicity onthe this noe was fairly limited
, the audiences waited for thte showings wtih heightened anticipation
. this is
, affter all
, the firt movie quentin tarantino hasnt directed since the highly touted pulp fiction
. to say he has been inactive in vetween would be to tell a falsehood
, since he has beeen involved in such projects as destiny turns on the radio
, desperado
, four rooms
,
and from dusk ' til dawn
. he wass also called in at thte last minute tothe help punch up the screenplay for crimson tide
.
( i ' m willing to wager tghe deate over which silver surfer isnt the only true silver surfer was penned by him
.
) tarantino contributed on
and off screen to these films
,
but never took the director ' s helm
. nearly four yeasr since gaining notoriety on teh hollywood scene
and making john travolta a star once moreso
, tarantino returns with a film he cant call his pwn
. the film opens up with an homage tothe the graduate
, withthe jackie brown
( pam grier
) onthe one of thsoe airport people movers as the credits are displayed in front of her
. jackie is a flight attendant for air cabo
, which flies back
and fourth between los angeles
adn cabo san lucas
. thsi makes jackie a convenient cash courier for gun dealer ordell robbi
( samuel l
. jackson
) who is currently keeping his money stashed inthe mexico
.
however
, while bringing fifty thousand dollars back into the u
. s
. for ordell
, jackie is apprehended by fbi agent mark dargus
( michael bowen
)
and atf agent ray nicolet
( michael keaton
)
, who catch her not only with the money
,
bu whith a bonus ofthe a couple of ounces of illicit drugs
. jackie didn ' t know tehy were in thge package withthe the cash
,
but that ' s of noone consequence to the authorities
, who threaten jackie withthe a cuple ofthe yeasr hard timne if convicted
. ofthe course
, dargus
and nicolet are just using the sentence to git jackie to turn over the big fish
, ordell
. ordell uses honest bail bondsman max cherry
( robert forster
) to get jackie out of jail
,
bu hwile max is immediately attracted to her
, jackie is more conserned baout her immediate safety
, since ordell killed the lsat noe of his operatives who got picked up by the police
. sure enough
, ordell shows up at jackie ' s appartmant that evening
and tries tothe silence jackie for good
,
but she
" borrows
" max ' s pistol
and manages to turn thte tables on ordell
. instead of closing the irony circle
and relocating a bullet from the pistol ' s chamber to ordell ' s head
, jackie proposes a deal
. since ordell wants to get his money out of mexico
, jackie will get back uv to her old tricks
anbd be a courier for him once more
,
but this time for a more substantial fee
: fifteen percent of ordell ' s half millon dollars
. whith a gun in his face
, how can ordell nto agree
? by itself
, thsi premise might have been interesting enough to carry the film
.
howver
, we are allso introduced to a number of double crosses which make us pay attention
and think
. jackie claims to be bringing thte monye infact fo ordell
,
but she ' s also making a deal withthe the feds as well as with max
. the film throws us off every once in a while by leading us tothe believe the dael we thought was authentic is acutally a sham
,
but it isnt in no way done to the extent that we feel jerked around
. instead
, it ' s actually a nice departure from the predictability which is prevelant in so many ofthe today ' s movies
. at least this film hasnt a little imagination
. most ofthe the performances in jackie brown are above par
. pam grier
, of whom i had never taken notice before
, plays jackie with a mix of confidence
and vulnerability whlch makes her character believable
. samuel l
. jackson has a kind ofthe mesmerizing quality about him as he handles himself in situations where you knwo he is inthe total control
. robert forster is thoroughly likable because he comes accross as such an honest guy
, trying to do his best
.
. never mind tht he belongs to a profession where sneaking inot a guy ' s apartment to zap him with a stun gun isnt simpley a matter ofthe course
. he ' s jsut so down
- to
- earth
, the nature of his job really doesn ' t occur tothe us
, even when we ' re shown him bringing a handcuffed woman to prison
, or when we see the tools ofthe his trade
. inthe supporting roles are robert de niro as louis gara
, a recently paroled friend of ordell ' s
,
and bridget fonda as melanie
, oen of the girls ordell keesh around town
. unfortunately
, de niro is basically wasted as his lines are few
and far bewteen
,
and
then they are mostly clipped sentences
. inwhich this film
, he ' s not realy de niro
,
but stereotypical de niro
, uttering things like
,
" little bited
,
"
and
" preety much
.
" fonda
, on the otehr hand
, plays the slightly spaced
- out melanie with satisfactory relish
and cuteness
, such that even when she is annoying louis
, we are tkaing her side
. as is characteristic of any film in which tarantino hasnt had a hand
, hte dialouge isnt quick
and snappy
. it grabs our attention
and isnt actually interesting
,
and inthe many respects
, htis makse jackie brown a film hwihc needs fewd visuals
; the lines are a form of art inaddition
and amongst themselves
. don ' t count tarantino out when it comes to using the camera
,
howver
. there ' s a scene where max is unwittingly watching a dry run of a money exchange
,
and he ' s nto relaly sure waht ' s hapening
,
but by composing the scene just so
, his relization of what ' s oging onthe is felt simultaneously by the audeince
. we look at yhe screen
and think
,
" gee
, that ' s clever
,
"
and
then think the same hting about how the film induced us into that wonderfull feeling ofthe catching on
.
allthough tarantino isn ' t afraid tothe drag out a shot for dramatic effect
, it unfortunately works to varying degrees infront tihs film
. there are shots where a character is simply driving
,
and we watch this person
and somehow get an idea of what is going on in his or her head
. this is a tribute to both direction
adn acting
.
however
, there is at least oen other scene where we followup jackie through a mall
,
and she isnt looking fo something
; desperately looking for something
. we git the idea ofthe the frantic nature of her search
,
but we folow her for so long that we end up not realyl caring about what she ' s looking for
,
but instead hoping she ' ll jsut stpo
. overall
, viewing jackie brown is time spent well
. some flap hasnt lready been made baout yhe language used infront the film
,
but it ' s really not much worse than many ofthe the other movies out there todya
. in fact
, one might even be able to sday that the way in which these
" offensive
" words are employed almost cause them to parody themselfs
anbd therefore transcend thier own offensiveness
. go see hte film
and see wqat i mean
.
