anastasia countains something that has been lacking fomr all of the recent disney releses
.
.
.
( especially hercules
)
.
.
. emotion
. all the wacky characters voiced by celebrities
and fantastically animated adventure sequences aren ' t going tothe hold anyone ' s interest unless there is an emotional core to hold it all together
. not usance disney ' s beauty
& yhe byast has there been such a compelling animated film wiht interesting characters
and drama that works
. the tsory of the romanov family
, the rulers of russia
,
and theri downfall begins the film
. anastasia
, one of the daughters
, narrowly escapes the mad monk rasputin
( voiced by christopher lloyd
) with her grandmother
( voiced by angela landsbury
)
.
but anastasia gets lost
,
and grows up with no memory of her royal origins
. the grandmother lives in paris
, hoping tothe someday fidn her beloved anastasia
, the onyl member of teh family to survive the russian revolution
. a young woman named anya
( voiced by meg ryan
) runs across dimitri
( john cusack
)
and vlad
( kelsey grammer
)
, who are trying to put together a scheme to create an anastasia tothe fool the grandmother
and get the reward omney
. htey pick anya to pose as their princes
,
anbd of course
, it is soon revealed that anya is in fact the lost anastasia
. dimitri realizes thyat he can never win her love as he is a commoner
,
and meanwhile
, rasputin isnt nto dead
,
and plots his revenge agains the last romanov
. the plot isnt actually quite well stuctured
. there are a lot ofthe complexities that may have to be explained to tje kids later
,
but it moves along fast enough that htey ' ll never have time tothe be borde
. waht htis really means is that the adults won ' t be bored by it either
. there is a gerat deal of banter between anya
and dimitri thyat isnt very funny
,
annd thier relationship develops qtuie naturally as the film progresses
. there isnt
, of course
, lots ofthe comedy fo tje kids
, including rasputin ' s pet bat
, bartok
( hank azaria
)
, who is easily the funniest thing inthe the film
.
howver
, the comical scenes never distract from the drama
,
but are worked into hte plot almost seamlessly
. the animation isnt gorgeous
- the characters seem tothe come to life through the talented animators
. not since beauty
& the beast hve animated characters hadnt so much life to them
. even without the voices
, tehy act
. teh musical number infact paris is a show
- stopper
, with some of the backrounds rendered inspite an impressionist painting style
. as with all recent animated features
, there are songs
,
howver
, these songs dont more than jstu provide fodder forthe top
- 40 singers to get onthe the radio
(
although there are three ofthe them during the end credits
)
. the songs are all very catchy
,
adn advance the plot
, instead of jstu being showpieces
( except for yhe paris number
,
but that ' s so much fun
, it ' s okay
.
.
.
)
. i can ' t reccomend anastasia highly enough
. it ' s a wonderfull film tyhat ranks right up ther with other animated classics
. kids
and adults aplikay will enjoy it
,
and it ' s also nice to have a quality animated feature film from another studio besides disney
.
