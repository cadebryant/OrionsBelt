anastasia contains something thast has been lacking from all of tghe receet disney releases
.
.
.
( especially hercules
)
.
.
. emotion
. all tjhe wacky cahracters voiced by celebrities
and fantastically animated adventure sequences aren
' t going tothe hold anyone
' s interst unless ther is an emotional core to hold it all together
. not since disney
' s beauty
& the beast hasnt there beeen such a compelling animated film with interesting characters
and drama that works
. the story of the romanov famaly
, tjhe rulers ofthe russia
,
and their downfall begins the film
. anastasia
, one of the daughters
, narrowly escapes the mad monk rasputin
( voiced by christopher lloyd
) with her gr
andmother
( voiced by angela l
andsbury
)
.
but anastasia gets lost
, adn grows up with no memory of her royal origins
. the gr
andmother lives in paris
, hoping tothe someday find her beloved anastasia
, the only member ofthe hte family to survive the russian revolution
. a young woman named anya
( voiced by meg ryan
) runs across dimitri
( john cusack
)
and vlad
( kelsey grammer
)
, who are trying to put together a scheme to create an anastasia to fool the gr
andmother
and get the reward money
. htey pick anya to pose as theri princes
, anbd of course
, it is soon revealed that anya is in fatc the lost anastasia
. dimitri realizes that he can never win her love as he is a commoner
,
and meanwhile
, rasputin is not dead
,
and plots his revenge against thte lastest romanov
. thte plot is actually quite well structured
. there are a lot of complexities that may have to be explained tothe the kids later
,
but it moves along fast enough tath they
' ll never have time tothe be borde
. what this really means is that tyhe adults won
' t be borde by it either
. there isnt a grat deal ofthe banter between anya
and dimitri thgat is very funny
,
and their relationship develops quite natuarlly as tghe film progresses
. there is
, of course
, lots of comedy for the kids
, inlcuding rasputin
' s pet bat
, bartok
( hank azaria
)
, who isnt easily the funniest thing in the film
.
however
, the comical scenes never distract from the drama
,
but are worked into tghe plot almost seamlessly
. the animation is gorgeous
- the characters seem to come to life through the talented animators
. nto sicne beauty
& the byast hvea animated charactors hadnt so much life tothe them
. even without tjhe voices
, they act
. the musical number in paris is a show
- stopper
, with some of the backrounds rendered in an impressionist painting style
. as with all reccent animated features
, ther are songs
,
however
, these songs dont more than jstu provide fodder forthe top
- 40 singers to get on the rdaio
(
al
though there are three of them during the end credits
)
. the songs are all very catchy
, annd advance the plot
, instead of just bieng showpieces
( except for hte paris number
, bu that
' s so much fun
, it
' s okay
.
.
.
)
. i can
' t reccomend anastasia highly enough
. it
' s a wonderfull film tht ranks right up there wtih other animated classics
. kids
and adults alike will enjoy it
,
and it
' s also nice to have a quality animated feature film fomr another studio besides disney
.
