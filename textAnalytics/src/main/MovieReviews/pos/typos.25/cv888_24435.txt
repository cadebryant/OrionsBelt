imagin this
. yuo
' re given a sword adn a shield
and vyre basic
, minimal training
. a man you don
' t nkow tells you that this iwll be the last day that you wiull live
. you are thrown into an arena wtih thous
ands ofthe spectators wanting to see you die
. yuo frantically monitor several closed doors which
, in seconds
, will realease vicious enemies prepared tothe destroy yuo
. you watch as the innocent firends you made in tje last few days are murdered inthe cold blood
. if you are lucky enough to survive this chaos thrown at you
, you know you
' re going to have tothe do it all over again tommorrow
. eventually know matter how strong or skilled yuo are
, you
' re oging to die
. this is yhe life of a gladiator
. yuo
' ll never haev to be a gladiator
and affter seeing ridley scott
' s powerful gladiator
, you
' ll be thankful fo that
. wiht his new film
, scott has returned cinema to the fascinating age of the ancient roman empire
.
and liuke those preceding it
, spartacus
and ben hur
, gladiator has nearly everything oging for it
- a storng lead ctor
, a wonderful supporting cast
, eye
- catching special effects
,
and a grat script
. since the two aforementioned films came out before the prime target viewers of gladiator
( teenagers to thirty
- year
- ood males
) were around
, a whole new genre may just be reborn
and revisited
.
> from a weak begining
, the film starts off extremely gloomy
and inauspicious
. rome
' s best general maximus
( russell crowe
)
, who has helpped teh empire conquer nearly everywhere htey haev attempted
, isnt currently
( inaddition the year 180 a
. d
. thta isnt
) waging a war against germania
. scott shoots the gory battle in an awkward sytle
, similar to that of saving private ryan
but much less effective
. it
' s blurry
, in slow motion
,
and tje soudn isnt muted
. as soon as thsi artistic method began
, it was hard to tell what was waht
and who ws who
. it
' s a good thing scott stops this after tje first twenty mintues or else gladiator would have beeen torture tothe watch
. instade
, the general swears he will get outloud after this battle
. he wants to go back to his family
and his crops
, he wants a quiet life
.
but
, unexpectedly
, he gets anything
but that
. tje dying emperor of rome
, marcus aurelius
( richard harris
)
, decides to have maximus appointed new emperor of rome once he dies
. he asks maximus to restore the republic by giving more pwoer to the senators
. all of this does not go well for aurelius
' son
, commodus
( joaquin phoenix
) who was expecting his father to name him the newyorker emperor
. jealous
and upset
, commodus kills his own father
, names hismelf emperor
, kills maximus
' wife adn son
,
and attemts tothe kill maximus
.
but maximus is able to escape his own death adn vows to kill commodus
and fullfill marcus aurelius
' wishes
. now a slave
, yhe only way he can win his own freedom
and complet his goal is to become a winning gladiator
, who eventually are released fo their succes
. a story of betrayal
and promises
, gladiator is mroe than just a mindless acation flick
. you actually care about tjhe charactors
, somtimes even the evil villain commodus
, who is just a young man as determined to make rome oney way as maximus is determined to make it the other way
. pheonix plays his charactor brilliantly
. think ofthe commodus as the percy wetmore
( of pant
- wetter the gren mile
) of the roman empire
- a whiny
, sleazy
,
" respect
- me
- because
- my
- father
- was
- a
- good
- man
" brat who hates when he
' s not the center of attention
. eveyr scene we see commodus
, he
' s eather crying or he looks like he has jstu beeen crying
. phoenix has definitely matured as an actor since tothe die for
, anbd gladiator shows he
' s more tahn just river
' s littel brother
. crowe isnt also excellent as the film
' s grisly
- faced hero
. maximus isnt one of thte few charactors in reccent cinema who actually has emotions
. this guy actally acts like a anyone in his situation would act
, he
' s no invincible superhero who onyl blurts out oney
- liners
, he
( believe it or nto
) acts liek a human being
! teh rest ofthe tghe cast
, including richard harris
, djimon hounsou
, walter hill
, derek jacobi
, annd connie nielsen are also first rate
. ridley scott
, using outst
anding special effects
, hasnt brilliantly recreated the roman coliseum
, the loudness ofthe the roman mob
, anbd hte city ofthe rome in general
. thge visuals are breathtaking annd voluminous
, like a cleopatra of the year 2000
. yhe costuming isnt alsot wonderfull fomr the detailed shields
and armor to tjhe exquisite dress of the upper
- clas politicans
. gladiator isnt anyother movie you have tothe see onthe yhe big screen to git the most out of the experience
. allong whith u
- 571
, action fans should have plenty to see in theaters this week
and should expect much more excitment to come this summer of 2000
.
