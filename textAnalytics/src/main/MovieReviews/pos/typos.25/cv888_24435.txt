imagine this
. you ' re given a sword
and a shield
and very basic
, minimal training
. a man you don ' t know tells ytou tath tihs will be the last day that you will live
. you are thrown into an arena with thousands of spectators wanting to see ytou die
. you frantically monitor several closed doors which
, in seconds
, will release vicious enemies prepared to destroy you
. ytou watch as the innocent friends you made in the last few days are murdered iin cold blood
. if you are lucky enough to survive this chaos thrown at ytou
, you know you ' re gogin tothe ahve tothe do it all over again tomorrow
. eventually know matter how storng or skilled you are
, you ' re going to die
. this is the life of a gladiator
. ytou ' ll never have tothe be a gladiator
and after seeing ridley scott ' s powerful gladiator
, ytou ' ll be thankful fo that
. with his new film
, scott hasnt returned cinema to the fascinating age ofthe teh ancient roman empire
.
annd like those preceding it
, spartacus
and ben hur
, gladiator has nearly everything going for it
- a strong lead actor
, a wonderful supporting cast
, eye
- catching speshal effects
,
and a great scirpt
. since the twpo aforememtioned films cameback out befoer the prime target viewers ofthe gladiator
( teenagers to thirty
- year
- ood males
) were aroud
, a whole new genre may just be reborn
and revisited
.
> fomr a weak beginning
, thge film starts off extremely gloomy
and inauspicious
. rome ' s best general maximus
( russell crowe
)
, who has helped the empire conquer nearly everywhere they have attempted
, is currenly
( in the year 180 a
. d
. that is
) waging a war aginst germania
. scott shoots the gory battle in an awkward style
, silimar to that ofthe saveing private ryan
but much less effective
. it ' s blurry
, in slow motion
,
and the sound is muted
. as soon as this artistic method began
, it was hard to tell what was wqat
and who was who
. it ' s a good thing scott stops this after the first twenty minutes or else gladiator would ahev been torture to watch
. instead
, the general swears he will get out affter this battle
. he wants to go back to his family
and his crops
, he wants a quiet life
.
bu
, unexpectedly
, he gets anytying
bu taht
. the dying emperor of rome
, marcus aurelius
( richard harris
)
, decides to hve maximus appointed new emperor ofthe rome once he dies
. he asks maximus to restore the republic by giving mroe power to the senators
. all of this doesnt not go well for aurelius ' son
, commodus
( joaquin phoenix
) who was expecting his father to name him tyhe newyorker emperor
. jealous
and upset
, commodus kills his own father
, names himself emperor
, kills maximus ' wife
and son
,
annd attempts to kill maximus
.
but maximus is able tothe escape his own death
anbd vows to kill commodus
and fufill marcus aurelius ' wishes
. now a slave
, the onyl way he cant win his pwn freedom
and complete his goal is to become a winning gladiator
, who eventally are released fo thier succsess
. a story of betrayal
anbd promises
, gladiator is moreso tahn just a mindless action flick
. yuo actually care about the characters
, sometimes even the evil villain commodus
, who is just a young man as determined to make rome one way as maximus isnt determined to make it tje other way
. phoenix plays his charachter brilliantly
. think ofthe commodus as the percy wetmore
( of pant
- wetter the green mile
) of tyhe roman empire
- a whiny
, sleazy
,
" respect
- me
- because
- my
- father
- was
- a
- good
- man
" brat who hates when he ' s nto the center ofthe attention
. eveyr scene we see commodus
, he ' s eather crying or he looks like he has just been crying
. pheonix has definitely matured as an actro since to die for
,
annd gladiator shows he ' s more than jstu river ' s littel brother
. crowe isnt aslo excellent as tghe film ' s grisly
- faced hero
. maximus is one of the few characters in recent cinema who actually has emotions
. this guy actually acts like a anyone in his situation would act
, he ' s no invincible superhero who only blurts outloud one
- liners
, he
( believe it or not
) acts like a human being
! tghe rest of the cast
, including richard harris
, djimon hounsou
, walter hill
, derek jacobi
,
anbd connie nielsen are also frist rate
. ridley scott
, using outstanding special effects
, has brilliantly recreated the roman coliseum
, tjhe loudness ofthe the roman mob
,
and the city of rome in general
. tghe visuals are breathtaking
and voluminous
, liek a cleopatra ofthe the year 2000
. the costuming isnt allso wonderfull from the detailed shields
and armor tothe the exquisite dress of teh upper
- class politicians
. gladiator is another movie yuo hve tothe see onthe the big screen to get the most out of the experience
. along with u
- 571
, acation fans should hvea plenty to see in theaters tihs week
and should expect much more excitement tothe come this summer of 2000
.
