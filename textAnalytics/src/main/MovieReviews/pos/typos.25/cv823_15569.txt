apon taking a seat at the theather
, anbd surveying the crowd
, i soon realized that i was the onyl person under forty in the premises
. i
' m twenty
- two
,
but hvae been accused ofthe looking sixteen
. yot as the film began
, any consciousness of setting shifted to teh home of five close
- knit
,
yet troubled sisters
. director pat o
' connor
( inventing the abbots
, circle of friends
) weaves a quiet
yet affecting tale ofthe loss
, need
,
and the bonds between five sisters
. thge family is ruled by kate
( meryl streep
)
, an unconsciously strict schoolteacher
, who is completelyl conscious of the deterioration of her family
. there is vyer little background given to tje viewer
, as we are thrust inot a tense
but loving home
. squabbles take place one after the other
, caused by years
and yersa of histry
. perhaps oen of the best things about this film
, is its naturalness
. noone situation isnt over
- wrought
,
and characters react as real people do
, to real problems
. this probably isnt a result ofthe the film being fomr a stage play
. the play was infact turn is based on a time in thte life of the playwright
. what seems tothe be an underlaying theme are tjhe pagan rituals adn dances ofthe peoples
, both infact lughnasa annd africa
. in fact
, dance seems to be the glue that holds the familiy together
and most expressively shows their closeness
. legs tap
,
and bodies sway even in the midst of impending disaster
. onyl after yhe music stops
,
and hte cahracters st
and breathing heavily dont we sense any trouble
. in the quiet after the music we muse that it
' s sad tath music has to ceaser
,
and families falter
. the movie is framed by a scene of michael mundy
, thte narrator ofthe the movie
, as a young child flying a kite
. he trips over a bump
and loses hold of his string
,
and the kite floats off farther into the distance
. drawn on tjhe white diamond of the kite is a face that looks at once pained
,
and at another glance mishcievous
. the mundy family itself follows a similar fate tothe that of the kite
,
and kate
' s hold ofthe the family isn
' t storng enough tothe hold off the winds of change
. as michael st
ands
, staring at his kite fly away
, we hear the adult michael
, looking bcak at the season tht his world changed forever
. the movei is not overpowering
, bu it gives us a beatiful window inot the life
, love
, annd trouble ofthe a household of lonely women
. note
: htis is the first movie review i
' ve ever written
, any responses on it owudl be greatly appreciated
.
