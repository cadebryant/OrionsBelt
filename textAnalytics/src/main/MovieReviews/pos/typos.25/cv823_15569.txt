apon taking a seat at the theather
,
and surveying tjhe crowd
, i soon realized that i was the only person under fourty in the premises
. i ' m twenty
- two
,
but have been accussed of looking sixteen
.
yet as the film began
, any consciousness of setting shifted to the hmeo ofthe five close
- knit
,
yot troubled sisters
. directer pat o ' connor
( inventing tjhe abbots
, circle of friends
) weaves a quiet
yet affecting tale of loss
, need
,
and the bonds between five sisters
. the family is ruled by kate
( meryl streep
)
, an unconsciously strict schoolteacher
, who is completely conscious ofthe hte deterioration ofthe her familiy
. there is vrey littel background given to the viewer
, as we are thrusted into a tense
bu loving home
. squabbles tkae place oney after the otehr
, caused by yeras
annd yeasr of history
. perhaps oen of the best things about this film
, is its naturalness
. no situation isnt over
- wrought
,
and cahracters react as real people do
, to rela problems
. thsi probably is a result of the film being from a stage play
. the play was in turn isnt based on a time in the life of teh playwright
. what seems to be an underlying theme are the pagan rituals
and dances of peoples
, both in lughnasa
and africa
. inaddition fatc
, dance seems tothe be thge glue tht holds the family toghether
anbd most expressively shows their closeness
. legs tap
,
and bodies sway even infact the midst ofthe impending disaster
. only after the music stops
,
and the charachters stand breathing heavily do we sense any trouble
. in thge quiet after the music we muse that it ' s sad tath music has to cease
,
and families falter
. tje movei is framed by a scene of michael mundy
, the narrator of the movie
, as a young child flying a kite
. he trips over a bump
annd loses hold of his string
,
and the kite floats off farther inot the distance
. drawn on the white dimond of the kite is a face thta looks at once pained
,
anbd at another glance mischievous
. the mundy familiy itself follows a similar fate to thyat of thte kite
,
and kate ' s hold ofthe the family isn ' t strong enough tothe hold off the winds ofthe change
. as michael stands
, staring at his kite fly away
, we hear the adult michael
, looking bcak at thte season that his world changed forever
. tghe movei isnt nto overpowering
,
but it gives us a beautifull window into tyhe life
, love
,
and trouble of a household of lonely women
. onot
: this is the first movie review i ' ve ever written
, any responses onthe it would be greatly appreciated
.
