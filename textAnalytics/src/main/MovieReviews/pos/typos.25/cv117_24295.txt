just look back twpo yeasr ago at the coen brothers
' comedic gem thge big lebowski
, chanage tyhe actors
, tkae away hte bowling alley
, add a recrod store
,
and you
' ve got high fidelity
( or maybe hte otehr way around since nick hornby
' s novel high fidelity came first
)
. either way
, it
' s been done before
, a trio of losers cracking jokes adn complaining about their failed romances
,
yet it remains consistently funny
. why is this
? maybe because you nkow your life is much better than this
, you know these guys are moreso pathetic than you are
,
and yuo nkow its ok to laugh at them becasue they
' re fictional
. director stephen frears
, possibly nto intentionally
, has created a movei that makes you feel good about yourself
and even tht ostensibly noone good uncle who watchs television twenty four horus a day
. wehn watching high fidelity
, expect to laugh at someone esle
' s pain
, realize what yuo are laughing at
,
and
then laugh again
. i laughed at dick
( todd louiso
)
, hte shy
, timorous
, steve buscemi character of lebowski
, who seems to know what he is talking about
but either can
' t put it inot words or is harshly rejected by his firends
. i laughed at the john goodman character barry
( jack black
)
, an exact replica of the comic bookstore owner on the simpsons
, pudgy
, egotistic
,
and obnoxious at hte smae time
. adn i laughed at rob
( john cusack
)
, the jeff bridges type
, whom the story revolves around
. rob isnt the character easiest tothe relate to
,
but he is nothing like yuo at all
. he uncontrollably cheats
and lies
,
then is unable to realize why he can not hold onto a woman
.
and like his other miserable friends
, pop music isnt where he inevitably goes for comfort
. he spends thte afternoons at his job quizzing his coworkers with obscure trivia or listening to new music
and eather deriding it or praising it
. whatever human emotions tghe clash
, aretha franklin
,
and bruce springsteen records hold
, rob annd co
. grasp them
and halp fill voids in their social lives
. rob hasnt built an extensive collection in his recrod store as well as his home
and he organizes them depending on what mood he is inaddition
. during this confuzled stage ofthe his life in whlch the movie focusses on
, rob isnt trying to cope with numerous rejections over the eyasr by visiting past girlfriends
and eventually asking why they dumped him
.
but these aren
' t any girlfriends
? these girls made the all time top five break ups in the history of rob
( rob
' s incessant use of lists show how pop music has played a major role in his life
)
. the plot in threee words is
: women anbd music
. tyhe aproach directer stephen frears takes by having the charismatic rob speak directly tothe the camera isnt very effective
. it gives high fidelity a quickly paced
, informal structure
, adjectives which perfectly parallel rob
' s own lifestyle
. it aslo helps oepn the viewer
' s eyes as tothe how annoying barry isnt
. jack balck steals the show with a hilariously realistic performance as a total sleaze ball
. just listening tothe him speak for five minutes makes the audience immidately sympathetic fo rob
, who must work with him eveyr day ofthe the week
. what frears does so well is that he makes us feel sorry for rob hwile laughing at his misfortunes
. john cusack plays his character convincingly
but it is the strong supporting cast
, consisting of big stars
and character actors
, thta really defines rob
. nowe instade of rob just tlaking to the camera
, aftter he explains something
, hte remaining cast members physically
and humorously create what he is trying to say
. tjhe only problem with high fidelity is that it doesn
' t end when it should ahve ended
. instead the movie goes on fo a torturous twenty mintues that seem a lot longer thna that
. also bruce springsteen is completely wasted iin a brief cameo halfway through the movie
. high fidelity is a cheerful
, old fashioned comedy with a voluminous soundtrack
and as many laughs
. i just hope hollywood keesh creating losers onthe the big screen
, they make everyone look
and fiel great
.
