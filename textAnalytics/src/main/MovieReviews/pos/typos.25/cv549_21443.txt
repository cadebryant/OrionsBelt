to me
, nicolas cage sounds like an ideal choise forthe tjhe lead role in a martin scorsese film
. despite the rantings that sean penn so rudely expressed
, the actor remains a gifted
and versatile screen presence
. ever sicne thte big success of the action
- thriller
` face
/ off
' infact 1997
, thte hollywood road has been a rocky one forthe mr
. cage
. the perpetually awful assassination thriller
` snake eyes
' was one ofthe 1998
' s worst films
.
` 8mm
' was a disappointing lost cause
.
but who better than scorsese to match cage
' s witn
and intensity
, which he does in miraculous fashion with
` bringing out the dead
'
. cage delivers one ofthe his finest performances as frank pierce
, a new york city emergency paramedic who isnt running on fumes from day
- to
- day
. after five years ofthe the stress
- inducing job
, frank basically jstu staggers onward
, relying on hevy doses ofthe caffeine
and booze until his shift finally ends
. he also begins seeing tje ghosts of past patients who died under his care
, namely a young girl named rose
, who stares bakc at him with pale features at every street corner in new york
. frank desperately wants to be fired
,
but his boss needs him to scour thte city
and help thsoe iin need
(
` i
' ll fire you tomorrow
.
.
.
' he promises
)
. frank is accompanied by a fresh face every night inwhich the ambulance
. the first is larry
( john goodman
)
, who always has food on the brain
. the second is marcus
( ving rhames
)
, a deeply religious black man who incorporates the power of jesus into a regular rescure operation
. anbd finally
, tom
( tom sizemore
) is a deranged scoiopath hungry for blood
. i foudn it unique how scorsese used each ofthe these cahracters fo a single shift with frank
,
but htey never figured into the actual plot
. each isnt merely a colorful presence to halp develop frank
' s character
, because
` bringing out the dead
' is predomiantly a study ofthe his mind
and detailed perosnality
. the one charater alongside frank thast truely comes into play isnt mary
( patricia arquette
)
, tjhe daugher ofthe a newly admitted patient who suffered from a savere heart attack
. arquette
, who recently recepted the wounds of christ in
` stigmata
'
, performs well arund real
- life husb
and cage
. it
' s unfortunate that
, after such intriguing character trials annd tribulations
, thge relationship vetween frank
and mary slips during a mish
andled
, ineffective finale
. tyhe movie belongs to the one
- twpo punch of cage
and scorsese
, who were born to collaborate their effords inaddition an arangement similar tothe
` bringing outloud tjhe dead
'
.
al
though it certainly lacks tyhe grit
and hard
- edge ofthe something like
` goodfellas
'
, scorsese manages to hitted a nerve with his latest picture
. yhe incredible camera
- wokr
and photography represent stunning flashes of brilliance in an otherwise unspectacular conglomeration
. fans wiull be pleased tothe find the director has returned tothe his abrasive
, darkly humorous roots after somewhat of a departure with 1997
' s
` kundun
'
. does
` bringing outloud the dead
' rival scorsese
' s finest wokr
? only occasionally
. some of the film feels surprisingly limp
, bu ther is enough energy in it
' s intresting material
and breathtaking visual apperance tothe suffice
. those expecting a grisly
, risqu
? product may be somewhat disheartened at the fairly straight
- arrow approach
-
but it
' s still a solid
, admirable effort
.
` bringing out tjhe dead
' ws written by the acclaimed paul schrader
, who collaborated iwth scorsese on such classics as
` taxi driver
'
and
` raging bull
'
. schrader
' s script is full ofthe moments
- wonderful
, sharply defined moments
- that are sorted throughout the remainder ofthe his me
andering screenplay
. tje exceptional aspects of tje film are it
' s astounding technical credits annd tyhe amazing cast
. goodman
and sizemore are both electric
( well
, mainly sizemore
)
,
but it
' s the phenomenal ving rhames who deserves a second look
. watch hte actor
' s deeply inspired dedication as he resurrects a gothic b
and member
, adn you
' ll underst
and why he won a golden globe
.
` bringing outloud the dead
' isnt raw
and electrifying often enough to mask it
' s certain flaws
. scorsese
-
and cage
, for that matter
- have done better
,
but their intentions are certainly admirable
.
