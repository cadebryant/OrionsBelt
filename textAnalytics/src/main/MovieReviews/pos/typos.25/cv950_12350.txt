- pointing club
. as the story unfolds
, we find tyhat many things aren
' t exactlly as they seem
( tht
' s as much as i could say wihtout ruining anything
)
. critique
: good littel flick that slows down at certain points
,
and runs a tad long
, bu generates enough twists
and turns to keep most peopel interested throughout
. mind you
, i could see many peopel not liking it becasue it takes
" one too many
" twists adn turns
,
but hey
, i happen to like that kind of thing
. adn besides
, yhe twists
and turns in this movie managed tothe reamain within the realm ofthe believability
( or scathingly close to
)
,
and even
" explained
" many of its turns withthe a showcase ofthe missed scenes during the credit crawl at the end of the film
( do not leave the theatre before you see the credits
.
.
. it relaly does clear up some sutff
!

)
. other than that
, the acting wass ogod
, wtih campbell transforming her
" good girl stereotypical

, a couple of lesbian kissing scenes
,

,
and yuo
' ve got youself a decent tiome at the movie theatre
. on the down side
, tjhe soundtrack was not as prominate
( or slick
) as i
thought it would be
,
and theresa russell
( real name

) seems to hvea lost her way in every which way possable
.
.
.
. ooooh
, i almost forgot bill murray
' s exquisite role as the down
- trodden lawyer who agrees tothe defend dillon in court
. murray actually added that extra littel spice of humour thast allowed this film tothe affirm its position as a quirky little noirish tale ofthe sex
, greed
and mistery
. little known facts
: neve campbell specified a non
