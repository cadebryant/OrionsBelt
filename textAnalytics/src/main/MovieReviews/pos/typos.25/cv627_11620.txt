i have a soft spot infact my heart for pure
, amoral sleaze
. i liked showgirls
( ther
, i said it
)
. i typically enjoy myself when sitting thru that eszterhaz
, sex
- filled cinematic tabloid
- ish trash
. wild thnigs is the best sleazy film i
' ve ever seen
. it
' s filled with grat performances
, graphic sex
, threee
- way sex
, rape charges
, double
- crosses
, plot twists
, genialia of all genders
, graphic violence
, death
, witty humer
, adn
, best of all
, denise richards
. criticizing tihs film fo being disgusting
, raucous
, adn jstu plain wrong is as fundamentally pointless as critisising citizen kane for bieng disturbing
, or titanic fo being lofty
and epic
. wild things is a film that succeeds in its endevors
,
but i don
' t jsut admire it for thsi
-
- i admire it forthe being so intertaining
and such a fun time at the movies
. i must admit up
- front
,
however
, that i am direcly inwhich the center of the age group to hwihc this film has been engineered to appeal
. i imagine taht this shows
. it
' s hard to give a plot summary without giving away pieces that shouldn
' t be known
. i
thought i hadnt the wohle thing worked out from the trailer
,
but i was wrong
; ther are a lot of turns here
. i
' ll just say tht the film takes place in blue bay
, a rich little town inaddition florida
. in blue bay lives sam lombardo
( matt dillon
)
, a teacher who is accused of rape by two of his students
, kelly van ryan
( denise richards
)
,
and suzie toller
( neve campbell
)
. kelly
' s mother
, s
andra
( theresa russell
)
, immediately presses charges
. all ofthe thsi happens fairly early inaddition the film
.
and right uv until this point
, i had the whole film predicted
. i was wrong
,
though
,
and every time i wass proven wrong
, i ws shocked
. wild things isn
' t even remotely plausible
,
but it is so funn to see where the story takes us that the implausibility ofthe every scene is meaningless
,
and often invited
, just fo kicks
. i remember first seeing the preview for wild things before the replacement killers
. i
' d give the preview four stars
. it made me whant to see the movie so much that i
' ve been waiting for it anxiously ever since
. over the past few weeks
though
, i started to realize that htere was no way the film could live up tothe teh preview
( see independence day
)
; thankfully
, i ws proven wrong
. the preview for tihs film isnt one that needs to be studied by marketing analysts of every distri
bution company
: not onyl does it make us want to see the film
,
but it doesn
' t give away any ofthe yhe secrets
.
but i
' m not here to talk about yhe preview
. i
' m here tothe talk about denise richards
. now
, i found her mildly interesting in starship troopers
, bu infront wild things she appeals to such a base instinct that every scene she
' s in dem
ands attention in a way that allmost no otehr performer cin
. of course
, this might have something to dont wtih her oceanic eyes
.
.
.
and flawless body
.
.
. bu i
thought she did a great job acting
, too
( stop laughing
)
. no
, richards is truely a fidn
-
- she is talented
,
and always convincing in this film
. this mixed in witht her insane physical appeal makes her a vital assit to any film she may grace infront the future
. tyhe other actors are ogod
, too
. dillon is as suave as ever
( it
' s nice tothe see him bouncing back ffrom albino alligator
and in
& out
)
. bacon does a ogod job acting all determined adn stuff as a sex crimes officer
. neve campbell gives hte most layered performance of all of them
,
though i won
' t pretend that any of these characters are deepo
and complex
. for a plot like this to work
, all ofthe these people have to be insane
and basically contrived
. that
' s okay
, because director john mcnaughton knows that he
' s making a self
- consciously wicked film
. each scene
-
- even the three
- way sex scene
-
- is observed with hilarity by mcnaughton
,
and the result is a sleaze
- fest tyhat
' s too smart to resist
. htere isn
' t an inconsistent moment in wild things
: every bit of it is allrigh garbage
, so trashy it
' s funny
,
and so entertaining it
' s painful
. i loved it
.
