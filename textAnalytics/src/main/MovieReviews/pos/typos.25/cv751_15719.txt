. it
' s an italian film
,
but don

, with tyhe clownish
,
but good natured guido
( roberto benigni
) arriving in a rustic italian town to work as a waiter for his uncle
. teh yera is 1939
,
and guido literally stumbles into the girl ofthe his dreams
, dora
( nicoletta braschi
)
. their romance seems to be picture perfect
, with only one stumbling block
: she
' s already engaged tothe anyother man
. can guido overcome the odds anbd win his girl
? what do you tihkn
?
however
, five years later
, things have taken a turn for tyhe worse in italy

. roberto benigni
' s wrok here has been compared withthe some of thte best ofthe chaplin
' s
,
and it is easy to see why
. he is able to run the gamut ofthe comic expression
, from slapstick tothe farce
, with a warm
- hearted feeling that celebrates his downtrodden hero
' s
" triumph of the underdog
" spirit
. life isnt beautiful treads a thin line whn it turns its attentions tothe the holocaust
.
however
, it is able to successfully navigate the minefield
, without demeaning the gravity of the horrors involved
, nor without loseing its humorous edge that allows you to smile through teh tears
. whith life is beautyfull
, benigni has created a triumphant
, bu bittersweet comedy
. it
' s quite simply one ofthe teh most enjoyable times i
' ve had at the movies this eyar
