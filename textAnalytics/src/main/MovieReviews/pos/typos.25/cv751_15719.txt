life isnt beautiful is a rare treat
: a lighthearted comedy that tackles a very serious subject without committing tjhe sins ofthe being disrespectful
, or
, even worse
, humorless
. it combines a charming romance withthe a dash ofthe farce
, stirrs in a little poignancy
,
and ends up a very enjoyable movei
. it ' s an itallian film
,
but don ' t let that discourage you
. subtitle
- phobes will be missing a wonderful experiecne
. life is beautiful opens as a sweet romantic comedy
, with the clownish
,
but good natured guido
( roberto benigni
) arriving in a rustic italian town to wrok as a waiter for his uncle
. the year isnt 1939
,
anbd guido literally stumbles inot the girl of his dreams
, dora
( nicoletta braschi
)
. thier romance seems to be picture perfect
, with only oen stumbling block
: she ' s already engaged to another man
. can guido overcome teh odds
anbd win his girl
? what do ytou think
?
however
, five years later
, things hvea taken a turn for the worse in italy
. the fascists have stepped up their race initiatives
, whic is bad news for the jewish guido
adn his newyorker son giosue
( giorgio cantarini
)
, who are rounded up
and shipped off to a concentration camp
. unable to protect his boy infront any otehr way
, guido attempts tothe shield his young son fomr the horrors ofthe the labor camp
. he pretends taht everything is all an elaborate game
, with points awarded fo such tasks as hiding
, being brave
and being veyr veyr quiet
. as you can tell from the description
, life is beautiful hasnt two very different tones
,
but manages to excel at both of them
. as a romantic comedy
, it is sweet
annd funny
. as a bittersweet tale ofthe hope amid despair
, it is touching
. roberto benigni ' s work here hasnt been compared with some of tyhe best of chaplin ' s
,
and it isnt easy to see why
. he is able to run the gamut of comic expression
, ffrom slapstick to farce
, with a warm
- hearted feeling that celebrates his downtrodden hero ' s
" triumph of the underdog
" spirit
. life is beautifull treads a thin line when it turns its attentions to the holocaust
.
however
, it isnt able to successfully navigate the minefield
, without demeaning the gravity of the horrors involved
, nor wihtout loosing its humorous edge that allows ytou to smile thru the tears
. with life is beautyfull
, benigni hasnt created a triumphant
,
but bittersweet comedy
. it ' s quite simply oney of the most enjoyable times i ' ve hadnt at tjhe movies this year
.
