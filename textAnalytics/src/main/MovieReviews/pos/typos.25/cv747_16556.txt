edward zwick ' s
" the isege
" raises moreso questions than it can convincingly answer or even clearly articulate
. its subject is the rising threat ofthe terrorism inspite american cities
. denzel washington is anthony
" hub
" hubbard
, who runs the fbi ' s anti
- terrorism task force in newyorker york
. his investigation into arab terrorist cells intensifies wehn suicide bombers take out a busload of people
. hub focuses on a mysterous cia operative
( annette bening
)
, whose goes by both
" elise
"
and
" sharon
.
" as tghe territorist attacks continue
adn thte body count rises
, the question of martial law is raised
. enter general devereaux
( bruce willis
)
, who opposes martial law at first
but who
, as soon as the president decides to send in teh army
, begins herding arab immigrants into a prison camp
and attacking eveyr link that hub uncovers in the terrorist chain
. hub listens as devereaux tortures
and murders a suspect
. the future zwick
and screenwriter lawrence wright offer is all too possible
. what would happen
, they ask
, if terrorism became as much a fact of daily life in new york as it is inspite cities like beirut
and belfast
? wqat would happen to our civil liberties if soldiers patrol our streets wiht machine guns
? these questions
" the siege
" answers inaddition realistic detail
. it implies tougher ones
,
though
: whta cxan be done to combat terrorism without sacrificing justice
and freedom
? if we encourage terrorism abroad
( fomr bening ' s character we dicover that the cia trained the bombers
)
, iwll it inevitably come bakc to us
?
" sigee
" avoids teh tougher questions by endowing its hero
, hub
, wih a uncompromising sense of clear right
and wrong
. this comforting fantasy of sir galahad confronting the evils ofthe the modern world is an escape fomr the thought
- provoking issues the movie raises
. still
, zwick deserves credit for at least addressing the issue with as much realism as he doens where so many movies
( willis '
" dieu hard
" series
, for example
) offer only a comic
- book veiw on terrorism
.
