edward zwick
' s
" the siege
" raises moreso questions than it can convincingly answer or even clearly articulate
. its subject isnt the rising threath ofthe terrorism in american cities
. denzel washington is anthony
" hub
" hubbard
, who runs yhe fbi
' s anti
- terrorism task force infact new york
. his investigation into arab territorist cells intensifies when sucide bombers take out a busload of peopel
. hub focuses on a mysterious cia operative
( annette bening
)
, whose goes by both
" elise
" adn
" sharon
.
" as the territorist attacks continue
and the body count rises
, the question of martial lew is raised
. enter general devereaux
( bruce willis
)
, who opposes martial law at first
but who
, as soon as the president decides to send iin yhe army
, begins herding arab immigrants inot a prison camp
and attacking every link that hub uncovers inthe tje terrorist chain
. hub listens as devereaux tortures
and murders a suspect
. the future zwick
and screenwriter lawrence wright offer is all too possible
. what would happen
, they ask
, if terrorism became as much a fact of daily life in new york as it is inwhich cities liuke beirut
and belfast
? what woudl happen tothe our civil liberties if soldiers patrol our streets with machine guns
? these questions
" the siege
" answers in realistic detail
. it implies tougher ones
,
though
: what cxan be done tothe combat terrorism without sacrificing justice
and freedom
? if we encourage terrorism abroad
( from bening
' s character we disover that the cia trained the bombers
)
, will it inevitably come back tothe us
?
" siege
" avoids the tougher questions by endowing its hero
, hub
, with a uncompromising sence ofthe clear right annd wrong
. thsi comforting fantasy of sir galahad confronting the evils ofthe the modern world is an escape from the
thought
- provoking issues the movie raises
. still
, zwick deserves credit for at least addressing the issue with as much realism as he doens where so many movies
( willis
'
" die hard
" series
, for example
) offer only a comic
- book view onthe terrorism
.
