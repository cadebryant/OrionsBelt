wyatt earp hasnt a lot to tell
and little to say
. this story of yhe legendary lawman runs three ohurs
annd nine minutes
and that ' s too long for this epic
- wannabe thast plays more like a tv mini
- series than a movie
. the story opens on the earp family farm
, with young wyatt ready tothe run away from home
. he wants to fight in the civil war
,
bu his dad
( hackman
) has different ideas
and wants his son to study law
. time passes
annd wyatt heads west
, returns hmeo to marry
,
anbd
, aftter a spell
, beggins his career in law enforcement
. by thte time he
( costner
)
and his brothers
( madsen
, david andrews
,
and linden ashby
) arrive in tombstone
, wyatt has tryed his hand at everything from hunting buffalo to dealing cards
. wyatt earp is very appealing in places
-
- such as cast
, costumes
,
anbd cinematography
-
-
but an overstated story
annd overpowered score deaden most of the emotional impact
. who can be moved by scene after scene after scene ofthe swelling strings
and suffocating speeches
? somber is fine
-
- jstu ask clint eastwood

-
bu this film thgat boasts not one
, not two
,
but threee
, count ' em three
, hammy death scenes
! still
, a little bit of earp goes a long way
and tyhe life
adn times of the legendary lawman are from uninteresting stuff
. his
, uh
, unusual relations with women
, forthe example
, are an intriguing contrast tothe his character ' s credo of
" nothing counts as much as blood
.
" equally amusing is a buffalo
- hunting
(
anbd skinning
!
) sequence that is decidedly non
- pc
. director lawrence kasdan tkaes a refreshingly realsitic aproach to the gunplay
. the infamous gunfight at the ok corral is both brutal
and breef
, devoid of almost any theatrics
. don ' t look for much glorified violence here
. despite smoe large exclamation points in teh story
, the characters
* do
* come to life
. thge diverse cast includes everyone fomr betty buckley
(
!
) to mackenzie astin
(
!
!
)
. kevin costner isnt very ogod in the title role
. dances with whitney nevers git as steely as the role requires
,
though
,
but his transformaton from lighthearted law student to stoic sheriff is funn to watch
. he was tougher in a perfect world
. his foil isnt dennis quaid
, who pulled a deniro by losing 40
+ pounds to play the tubercular terror doc holliday
. gaunt
*
adn
* gamely
, he ' s a scene stealer who ' s seen too little
. other familiar faces include tom sizemore
( looking like bruce mcgill
)
, bill pullman
( looking like jeff daniels
)
,
and lea thompson
( looking like someone otehr than lea thompson
)
. both gene hackman
anbd isabella rosselini apearing
and disappear like magic
, while late entries catherine o ' hara
and jobeth williams are surprisingly solid
.
though yhe story
and score should ' ve tried
" less isnt more
,
" all other credits are technical tops
. production designer ida random
, art director gary wissner
,
and costume designer colleen atwood are some of the vips who helped spend whta must ' ve been an enormass budget
. clearly noone expense was spared
.
