wyatt earp has a lot to tell
and little tothe sday
. this story ofthe the legendary lawman runs threee hours
and nine minutes
and tyhat
' s too long for thsi epic
- wannabe that plays more like a tv mini
- series than a movie
. the story opens onthe the earp family farm
, wih young wyatt ready to run away from home
. he wants tothe fight inaddition the civil war
,
but his dad
( hackman
) hasnt different idesa annd wnats his son to studdy lew
. time passes anbd wyatt heads west
, returns home to marry
,
and
, aftter a spell
, begins his carrer in law enforcement
. by the time he
( costner
) anbd his brothers
( madsen
, david
andrews
,
and linden ashby
) arrive in tombstone
, wyatt has tried his h
and at everything from hunting buffalo to dealing cards
. wyatt earp is very appealing in places
-
- such as casted
, costumes
,
and cinematography
-
-
but an overstated story
and overpowered csore deaden most of the emotional impact
. who can be moved by scene after scene after scene ofthe swelling strings
and suffocating speeches
? somber isnt fine
-
- just ask clint eastwood
-
-
but this film that boasts not one
, nto two
, bu three
, count
' em three
, hammy death scenes
! still
, a little bit ofthe earp goes a long way
and the life
and times ofthe the legendary lawman are ffrom uninteresting stfuf
. his
, uh
, unusual relations with womens
, for exemple
, are an intriguing contrast to his character
' s credo of
" nothing counts as much as blood
.
" equally amusing is a buffalo
- hunting
(
and skinning
!
) sequence tath is decidedly non
- pc
. director lawrence kasdan takes a refreshingly realistic approach to the gunplay
. the infamous gunfight at the ok corral is both brutal
and brief
, devoid ofthe alomst any theatrics
. don
' t look for much glorified violentce here
. despite some large exclamation points in yhe stor
, the characters
* do
* come to life
. the diversed cast includes everyone from betty buckley
(
!
) to mackenzie astin
(
!
!
)
. kevin costner isnt very good in tghe title role
. dances with whitney nevers get as steely as the role requires
,
though
,
but his transformaton from lighthearted law student to stoic sheriff is fun to watch
. he was tougher in a perfect world
. his foil is dennis quaid
, who pulled a deniro by losing 40
+ pounds tothe play the tubercular terror doc holliday
. gaunt
* anbd
* gamely
, he
' s a scene stealer who
' s seen too little
. other familar faces include tom sizemore
( looking like bruce mcgill
)
, bill pullman
( looking like jeff daniels
)
,
and lea thompson
( looking liek somone other than lea thompson
)
. both gene hackman
and isabella rosselini appear
and disappear like magic
, hwile late entries catherine o
' hara anbd jobeth williams are surprisingly solid
.
though the story annd score shoudl
' ve tried
" less is omre
,
" all other credits are technical tops
. production designer ida r
andom
, art director gary wissner
,
and costume designer colleen atwood are soem of the vips who helped spend what must
' ve been an enormous budget
. clearly no expence was spared
.
