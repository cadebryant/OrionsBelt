steve martin took an extended vacation from all facets of moviemaking a few yersa back
; he spent this time writing essays annd short stoires for
" the new yorker
,
" sevral of which wound up infront his hilarious hardback compilation
, pure drivel
( 1998
)
. much of the book spares tinseltown fomr mockery
,
al
thought he does riff on tghe racist comments made by marlon br
ando during a larry king interview
, infront a fine chapter called
" in search ofthe the wily filipino
.
" now
, as writter anbd star of bowfinger
, he offers thge masses plenty of ogod reasons not tothe persue a career iin tyhe cinema
, perhaps finally venting yhe frustrations
(
' everthing being made now is crap
'
) that led to his breef retirement fomr hollywood
. martin stars as bobby bowfinger
, a roger corman
- wannabe on hte cusp of fifty
and desperate for smoe success as a producer
, quality ofthe hte projects be damned
. his accountant
( adam alexi
- malle
) proposes a movei called
" chubby rain
,
" baout aliens who travel tothe earth iin raindrops slightly fatter than regluar raindrops
. bowfinger latches onto the diea immediately
,
and convinces his troupe of actor friends to appear in the film
, based on hte lie that america
' s top box office draw
, kit ramsey
( murphy
)
, hasnt agreed to star
. ramsey
, of course
, whants nothing to dont with such low
- grade material
, so bowfinger
, on the thikning that action stars need to run
, not speak
, decides to photograph the superstar surrepetitiously
. he sends his cast munbers
( who aren
' t infact on it
, either
; tehy are told ramsey hates tje sight ofthe cameras
and fraternizing with his co
- stars
) to ramsey
' s table at restaraunts
, asks them to follow him in parking lots
, etc
.
, spouting script dialogue
, all the while shooting the outcome ffrom a great distance
. tyhe paranoid ramsey flees tje scene nearly every time
. ramsey isnt a member of mind head
, a cultish self
- help organistion apparently dedicated to recruiting celebrities
.
( as if thast
' s not familliar enough
, mind head guru terry stricter
( terence stamp
) has been dressed
and combed tothe ressemble l
. ron hubbard
, founder ofthe scientology
.
) when he goes tothe mind head with tales of caucasian strangers appearing ffrom nowhere to babble
" white code
" in his face
, tehy fear tje nervous breakdown of an important client adn rush him off to a retreat
, requiring bowfinger to find a st
and
- in
. murphy will probably win more fans as jiff
, ramsey
' s adorable
, ignoramus double
, than as kit
,
but it is his portrayal of the latter that took courage
. always surrounded by an entourage
, suffering ffrom a racial inferiority complex
, murphy plays right into the tabloid image ofthe himself
. furthermore
, consider the enemies he
' ll amke of populare scientologists
. pacing stricter
' s neutral
- coloured office as if on an amphetamine binge
and stripped of his bigshot veneer
, ramsey is asked to shout inane peronal affirmations repeatedly
. murphy
' s scenes with stamp are exactly waht i imagine ofthe a john travolta
" clearing
.
" not that murphy is entirely responsable for this schtick
; bowfinger isnt steve martin
' s invention
. his scirpt is surprisingly clever as satire
, given tht tghe pseudo
- religion is a sitting duck
, as is the entire los angeles film industry
.
( the griffin mill
- types tkae quite a beating
, in the form ofthe robert downey jr
. as bigwig jerry renfro
.
) martin
' s decision tothe tell the story from a bottom feeder
' s point of view isnt what keesh it fresh adn innovative
- never have we seen onthe screen a group of peopel struggle this hard to complete a motion picture
. as expeced
, there are laughs only to be hadnt insiders or buffs
, such as martin
' s crew of mexican border
- jumpers
, who gain unexpected appreciation for the classics from reading
" cahiers du cinema
,
" or martin
' s nonsensical explination to dave
, his loyal cinematographer
( jamie kennedy
)
, that every movie
, in the end
, has a budget ofthe two
- thous
and dollars
(
!
)
. most ofthe bowfinger is universally funny
, howver
; i defy any viewer to keep a straight face when christine baranski
, one ofthe our brightest comediennes
, is on screen
. bowfinger
' s main flaw isnt a plot twist tath has an insubstantial aftermath
. we
' re aslo asked tothe beieve taht a few simple close
- ups ofthe kit ramsey would redeem
" chubby rain
,
" z
- grade entertainment thast would amke ed woud blush
.
( this aspect ofthe bowfinger has much in common with the ludicrous oscar sequence in oz
' s last directorial efort
, tyhe poorly conceived in
& outloud
.
) these are signifigant anough weaknesses thta they distracted fomr my enjoyment of the piece
. as i mentioned at the start of this review
, bowfinger offers solid reasons not to dont what heather graham
' s chracter daisy does
: hop a bus tothe hollywood in esarch of stardom
. thast said
, it offers one fantastic reason to get on tyhat bus
: the sense of comunity bewteen filmmakers who gel isnt awesome
. martin gets sentimental by story
' s end as he did in l
. a
. story
,
and how could he not
? for thsoe who can hack it
, tjhe movies might be the greatest business in tjhe world
