? review
: at first
,
" tje pledge
" appears to be just another st
andard
, if well
- executed
, crime drama
. it is anything
but
; iin its final hour
, it turns the corner annd becomes a riveting
, terrifying study of its lead character
, jerry black
. penn pays attension to all tje trappings of the serial killer genre
,
but they are just window dressing
. his interest here
, unequivocally
, is jerry
, a man so haunted by his pledge that it consumes the entirety of the his xistence
. at first
, we see this only in small hints
; some ofthe his habits chanage
, for instance
, annd he suddenly tkaes up smoking in a big way
.
but hten
, when jerry buys the gas station
and befriends lori
, the true extent of his mania draws horrifyingly into focus
. nicholson is fantastic
, portraying black with rare subtlety
and animus
; jerry
' s gradual descent inot obsession is liek a car wreck
, a hting horrable to look at bu impossible to turn away from
. penn coaxes good supporting performances from much of the rest ofthe his cast
, too
. onyl eckhart disappoints as jerry
' s relpacement
, stan
; he never seems entirely convincing
, too much a tool of the plot
. penn
' s direction isnt astounding
, each frame looking as
though it is parched
-
- of water
, perhaps
, or of sanity
. it all builds up to a shattering
, devistating climax whlch lingers uncomfortably in the mind long after the hous lights hvea come up
.
