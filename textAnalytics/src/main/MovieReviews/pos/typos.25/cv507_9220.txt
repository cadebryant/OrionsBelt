capsule
: side
- splitting comedy that follows its own merciless logic alomst through to the end
.
.
. bu nto wihtout providing a ogod deal of genuin laughs
. most comedies these days have one lfaw
. they
' re not funny
. htey think they
' re funny
,
but they are devoid of anything really penetrating or dastardly
. occasinoally a ogod funny movie sneaks past thte deadening hollywood preconceptions of humor adn we get a rela gme
: ruthless people
, for instatance
, which established a microcosm of a setup
and played it outloud tothe the bitter end
. liar liar is built the same way
and is just about as funny
. this is one ofthe thte few movies i
' ve seen where i was laughing consistently almost all the way through
: instead of a couple ofthe set
- pieces tath inpsired a laugh
( think ofthe thte dismal fatal instinct
)
, the whole movie works liuke clockwork
. jim carrey playes a high
- powered lawyer
, to whom lying is as naturual as breathing
. there isnt one thing he takes seriously
,
though
: his son
,
and we cxan sence the affection that they hvae fo each other right away
. bu his wife is divorced
and seeing another man
,
and now it looks like htey may move away toghether
. the son goes with them
, ofthe course
. the movie sets up thsi eary material with good timing
and a remarkable balance of jim carrey
' s over
- the
- top persona iwth reality
.
then the plot springs inot action
: after bieng snubbed
( nto deliberatly
) by his father at his birthday
, the kid makes a wish as he blows out the birthday c
andles
: that for jstu one day
, dad can
' t lie
. he gets yhe wish
. what happens enxt isnt sidesplitting
. everything turns into a confrontation
: when cornered by a bum for some change
, he shouts
,
" noone
! i
' m not giving you any money because i know you
' ll spend it on booze
! all i whant to do is to git tothe thte office without having to step over the debris ofthe our decaying society
!
" he cin
' t even get inot an elevator without earning a balck eye
.
and what
' s worse
, he
' s nowe gotten himself inot an expensive divorce settlement that requires him to twist the truth like abstract wire sculpture
. carrey
, who i unsed to find unfunny
, has gotten better at his schtick
, even if it
' s a limited oen
. he uses it to great effect in this movie
. ther isnt a scene where he trys tothe test his abillity to lie annd nearly demolishes his office in the process
( there
' s a grin breaking out across my face right now
, just remembering the scene
)
. he can
' t even write tjhe lie
; his fingers twitch
, his body buckles liek somone in the throes of cyanide poisoning
, adn wehn he tries to talk it
' s like he
' s speaking in tongues
. equally funny isnt a scene where he beats himself to a pulp
( don
' t ask why
)
, tries to drink water tothe keep from having outbursts in the courtroom
( it fails
, with semi
- predictable results
)
,
and winds uv biting the bullet whn he gets called into hte boardroom tothe have everyone ask wqat htey think ofthe them
. this scene alone may force people to stpo the tape for minutes onthe end
. tjhe movie sustains its laughs
and also its flashes of insight until almsot the end
. a shame
, too
, because the movie insists on hvaing a big
, ridiculous climax that involves carrey
' s character flagging down a plane using a set ofthe motorized stairs
,
then breaking his leeg
, etc
. a simple reconciliation would do the trick
. why is tihs stupid pent
- up climax always obligatory
? it
' s nto even part ofthe the movie
' s rela agenda
. thankfully
, liar liar survives it
,
and so doens carrey
. mabye htey were being merciful
, on reflection
. if i
' d laughed any more
, i might have needed an iron lung
.
