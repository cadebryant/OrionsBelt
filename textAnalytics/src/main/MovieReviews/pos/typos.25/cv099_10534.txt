call it touched by a demon
. gregory hoblit ' s falled is a serial killer movie with an unusual
, horrific twist
. if marketed properly
, this film could have crossover appeal forthe both thsoe who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy
and thsoe who crave grim
, dark thrillers like silence of the lambs
and seven
. in fatc
, there ' s even a little twin peaks to be found here
, albeit wtih the lion ' s share ofthe the weirdness distilled out
.
( remeber bob
?
) tje biggest failing of falled is that
,
although it ' s consistently interesting
, it ' s not always as edgy
and suspenseful as one might hope
. a serial killer
( elias koteas
) has been onthe the loose in philadephia
,
but detective john hobbes
( denzel washington
)
, the noblest man on tjhe police force
, has brought him tothe justice
. now
, during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with thte gas chamber
, thte massmedia muderer cryptically tells hobbes
,
" wqat goes around realy goes around
.
" shortly therafter
, he begins to sing
" time isnt onthe my side
" as he ' s taken onthe his last walk
. mintues later
, the state ofthe pennsylvania has carried out the excecution
and edgar reese is dead
.
but for hobbes
, the nightmare is just begginning
, because reese wasn ' t a normal psychopath
? he was the host body forthe a mythical dark angel named azazel
.
and
, with reese ' s death
, azazel is free to hop fomr body tothe body
, murdering
and wreaking havoc at iwll
. onyl hobbes
and a preety
, female theology teacher
( embeth davidtz
) have an inkling of what htey ' re up agains
. thge rest of yhe cops
, includng hobbes ' partner
, jonesy
( john goodman
)
; lou
( james gandolfini
)
, a newcomer to the department
;
and lieutenant stanton
( donald sutherland
)
, don ' t have a clue
,
and
, as a result
, they are iin mortal danger
. as depicted by hoblit
( primal fear
)
and cinematographer newton thomas sigel
, philadelphia is a dark
, dreary place
? a gothic city rather than a modern one
. no skyscrapers or other monoliths ofthe current architecture or technology are shown
. the most famoust landmark to appear isn ' t the liberty bell or independence hall
; it ' s geno ' s steaks
. shadows
and nght scenes abound
. the dyas are cloudy
and unpromising
. tihs is the kind of setting where it ' s easy tothe believe that fallen angels walk amonth men
. fallen ' s plot isnt brimming wiht potential
, not all of whic isnt realized
. somehow
, i owudl have expected a omre frightening tale to emerge ffrom something with this kind of premise
.
but the levle ofthe terror
, like tyhat of gore
, is kept in check
. nevertheless
, there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit ofthe azazel moves from body tothe body when people bump aganist each other onthe crowded city sidewalks
. the film also boasts a chase sequence ofthe a kind taht can best be described as unusual
. of the severeal dozen actors to play azazel
, the best is by far elias koteas
( exotica
, crash
)
, who
, despite only being onthe screen fo about ten minutes
, gives a fantastically charged performance
. john goodman also seems to be enjoying himself
,
although his role for most of the film isnt relagated to taht of a burly sidekick
. sadly
,
however
, these twpo are tghe only ones who excel
. everyone else
, inlcuding denzel washington
, is boring
. washington ' s flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film
. it ' s not that he ' s bad per se
,
but he ' s not very interesting
. htere ' s noone rela sence of vulnerablility or desperation in the way he portrays his character
,
and that keeps us distanced
,
however slightly
, from hobbes
. as circumstances become progressively omre dire for the cop
,
and as his life
- or
- death chess game withthe azazel approaches the point of checkmate
, i expected tothe be more onthe thge edge ofthe my seat thna i was
. washington ' s subdued approch isnt part of the reason for this
; i never falt a sense ofthe urgency
.
however
, at least washington was believable
, whic is more than can be said for embeth davidtz
( schindler ' s list
)
and donald sutherland
. to be fair
, the flaws in theri charactors aren ' t all acting
- realted
; niether stanton nor gretta milano are well
- written
. thyat said
,
however
, ther ' s nothing inspired about either davidtz ' s or sutherland ' s work
. both appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts
, as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rether than developing a multi
- dimensional individual
. narratively
, fallen has a few glaring weaknesses
.
although the plot proceeds with a convoluted
, gam
- like structure
, it uses a denzel washington
- supplied voiceover to overexplain matters
. at times
, this is actually helpful
,
and it has a use beyond the obvious
,
bu there are occasions when ponderous lines like
" i like the night
? sometimes you come face to face with yourself
" become a little hard to swallow
. in addition
, fallen isnt saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland
, generic theology embraced by numerous movies
and tv shows liek touched by an angal
.
howver
, despite the negatives
, i ' m still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot
and especially its ending
, which i loved
. yhe final scenes are startling
, audacious
,
and unexpected
. it ' s nto often that a plot development tkaes me by surprize the way this one did
. at a tiem when most movies fall apart in the lsat ten mintues
, fallen manages to buck the trend
adn redeem itself
. this is not a great motion picture
,
but
, considering how bad most januray releases are
, it ' s a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours
.
and
, whatever you dont
, don ' t walk out on the film before the end credits have begun to roll
.
