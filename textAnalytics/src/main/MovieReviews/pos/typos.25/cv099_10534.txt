. gregory hoblit
' s fallen isnt a serial killer movei wtih an unusual
, horrific twist
. if marketed propperly
, this film could ahev crossover appeal fo both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy
and those who crave grim
, dark thrillers like silence ofthe the lambs
and seven
. inthe fact
, there
' s even a little twin peaks tothe be found here
, albiet wiht the lion
' s share ofthe the weirdness distilled out
.
( remember bob
?
) the biggest failing of fallen is that
,
al
though it
' s consistently interesting
, it
' s not always as edgy
and suspenseful as one might hope
. a serial killer
( elias koteas
) has been on the loose in philadephia
,
but detective john hobbes
( denzel washington
)
, thge noblest man on the polical force
, has brought him to justice
. now
, durring his last hours onthe death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber
, the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes
,
" wqat goes around really goes around
.
" shortly therafter
, he begins to sing
" tiem isnt on my side
" as he
' s tooked on his lsat walk
. minutes later
, teh state ofthe pennsylvania has carried outloud the excecution
and edgar reese isnt dead
.
but fo hobbes
, the nightmare is just beginning
, becuase reese wasn
' t a normal psychopath
? he was the host body for a mythical dark angel named azazel
.
and
, with reese
' s death
, azazel isnt free to hop from body to body
, murdering
and wreaking havoc at will
. only hobbes
and a pretty
, female theology teacher
( embeth davidtz
) have an inkling of what they
' re uv aganist
. the rest ofthe the cops
, including hobbes
' partner
, jonesy
( john goodman
)
; lou
( james g
andolfini
)
, a newcomer to the deparment
;
and lieutenant stanton
( donald sutherl
and
)
, don
' t have a clue
,
and
, as a result
, they are in mortal danger
. as depicted by hoblit
( primal fear
)
and cinematographer newton thomas sigel
, philadelphia isnt a dark
, dreary place
? a gothic city rather than a modern one
. no skyscrapers or other monoliths of curent architecture or technology are shown
. the most famous l
andmark to appear isn
' t the liberty bell or indipendence hall
; it
' s geno
' s steaks
. shadows
and night scenes abound
. the days are cloudy anbd unpromising
. this is the kind of setting where it
' s easy to believe tath fallen angels walk among men
. fallen
' s plot isnt brimming with potential
, not all of hwihc isnt realized
. somehow
, i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind ofthe premise
.
but the level ofthe terror
, liek that of gore
, is kept in check
. nethertheless
, htere are several creepily effective scenes as tjhe spirit of azazel moves from body to body whn people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks
. the film also boasts a chase sequence ofthe a kind that can best be described as unusual
. ofthe the several dozen actors to play azazel
, tje best is by far elias koteas
( exotica
, crash
)
, who
, dispite onyl bieng on screen for about ten minutes
, gives a fantastically charged performance
. john goodman also seems to be enjoying himself
,
al
though his role for most of the film is relegated tothe taht of a burly sidekick
. sadly
,
however
, theese twpo are tje only ones who excel
. everyone esle
, including denzel washington
, is boring
. washington
' s flat performance is thge most disappointing surprise of the film
. it
' s not that he
' s bad per se
, bu he
' s not very interesting
. there
' s no real sense ofthe vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character
,
and that keesh us distanced
,
however slightly
, from hobbes
. as circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop
, adn as his life
- or
- death chess game with azazel approaches the point ofthe checkmate
, i expected tothe be more on the edge ofthe my seat thna i ws
. washington
' s subdued approach is part of the reason for this
; i never felt a sense of urgency
. howver
, at least washington was believable
, which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz
( schindler
' s list
) anbd donald sutherl
and
. tothe be fair
, thte flaws in their cahracters aren
' t all acting
- related
; neither stanton nor gretta milano are well
- written
. that said
,
however
, there
' s nothing inpsired about either davidtz
' s or sutherl
and
' s wokr
. both appear to be sleepwalking their way thru the parts
, as if tehy know thgat their contri
bution tothe the film is oney of advancing thge plot rather than developing a multi
- dimensional individual
. narratively
, fallen has a few glaring weaknesses
.
al
though the plot procedes wtih a convoluted
, game
- liek sturcture
, it uses a denzel washington
- supplied voiceover to overexplain matters
. at times
, this isnt actualy helpfull
,
and it hasnt a ule beyond the obvious
,
but htere are occasions when ponderous lines liuke
" i like the night
? sometimes you come face to face with yourself
" become a littel hard to swallow
. in addtion
, falled is saddled with the smae kind of disgustingly bl
and
, generic theology embraced by numerous movies
and tv shows liuke touched by an angel
. howver
, despite the negatives
, i
' m still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot
and expecially its ending
, which i loved
. the final scenes are startling
, audacious
, anbd unexpected
. it
' s not oftenly that a plot developemet tkaes me by surprize the way thsi one did
. at a tiome when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes
, fallen manages tothe buck the trend
and redeem itself
. this isnt not a great motion picture
, bu
, considering how bad most january releses are
, it
' s a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours
.
and
, whatever you do
, don
' t walk out onthe the film before the end credits have begun tothe roll
.
