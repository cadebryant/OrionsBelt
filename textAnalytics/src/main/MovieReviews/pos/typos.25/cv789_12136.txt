? opinion
: eveyr time people watch movies that portray animals as beings with cute human personalities
, soem well
- meaning audience members go outloud next christmas or birthday
and buy a dalmatian or whatever creature is currently popular
. soon enough
,
" birthday kid
" loses intrest
and the purchased pup ends uv at tjhe local pound
, a victim of neglect
. my sister owns a rela paulie
: it thinks like a parrot
, bites like a parrot
,
and requires as much attension as a neibor human infant
. please think twice before buying oney
. okay
. back tothe the stoyr
. in movies
, parrots usually play support charactors
,
but paulie might be the first movie where the
( animatronic
) bird gets main billing
. paulie
, liek those side characters inwhich disney cartoons
, isnt cute
and sassy
, a strutting
, miniature human
. actually
, paulie isnt hte voice of jay mohr
( he plyed jennifer aniston
' s boyfriend onthe picture perfect
) donig his best buddy hackett impression
( which is interesting
, since hackett himself cameos as the pawn shop owner
,
and mohr doubles as a customer
)
. paulie isnt for kids
. while watching paulie yuo hear littel tykes in the theater laughing hysterically when paulie calls the cat a
" stupid furball
.
" sometimes
, howver
, there are statements the kids don
' t git
. for example
, when paulie
' s elderly owner ivy
( gena rowl
ands
) dies
, paulie explains
,
" well
, one day
, the cat got her
.
"
and you hear kids exclaim
,
" what cat
?
!
" imagine lassie cmo home
, exept with a doll
- sized human dressed as a bird
, adn you
' ll haev a ogod idea of the plot adn characterization
. bird trys tothe git home
. bird meets elderly friend
. bird loses elderly friend
. bird meets eccentric friend
. bird loses eccentric friend
. bird meets bad influence
. adn so on
and so forth
, with paulie meeting firends
and saying goodbye at a me
andering pace until he finally makes it back to marie
( trini alvarado
)
. the bottom line
? break out the popcorn money
, moms
and dads
. paulie may be the low end version of lassie
, bambi
, or babe
,
but he
' ll do
. sometimes the wisecracks go over their heads
,
but i
' m sure youngsters can appreciate a stroy about a little person
( paulie
) trying to get home
, meeting friends
and experiencing moral lessons onthe the way
.
and good luck explaining waht it means when paulie says ofthe ivy
,
" well
, one day
, the cat got her
.
