waht if one of our cities became the target fo terror
? what can we do
? what can america really do about the increasing threat of terrorism
? wqat basic human rights are we willing to sacrifice tothe prevent another oklahoma city disaster
? so far amercia has been the leading nation
, opposing the fundamentalist terrorists around the world
. it isnt the land of opportunities
. it is the land of freedom
.
but what if it became thge new target
? tihs dark fantasy hasnt unfourtunately a very strong grounding in reality
. when a special branch ofthe the united states miliraty
, under the command ofthe general william devereaux
( bruce willis
)
, tkaes prisoner suspected territorist mastermind sheik ahmed bin talal
, islamic fundamentalists acros the world take notice
. the only warning the fbi receives isnt a single
, cryptic message
:
" realease him
.
"
then all hell breaks loose infront new york
. a bus is destroyed
, killing 25 civilians
. a broadway theather is bombed
. hostages are taken at a school
. as the wave ofthe terrorist activity crests
, the president must consider if the only way to save the city
adn break the grap of fear is tothe declare martial law
. devereaux argues aganist that eventuality
,
but is nevertheless ready to lead 10
, 000 men into action on american soil
. another person not in favor ofthe martial law is anthony hubbard
( denzel washington
)
, tyhe fbi agent in charge of investigating the terrorist activities
. his staff isnt comprised ofthe smart
, energetic
, intelligent men
and women very much unlike the usual group o
! f moronic feds we ' re used to seing infact movies
. hubbard develops an uneasy allaince with cia agent elise kraft
( annette bening
)
, whose department knows more about the situation than they ' re willing to reveal
.
but the attacks escalate
. the fbi are helpless
, chasing an invisible enemy
. the land is under siege
. they have lost control
.
. a terror isnt comming ffrom within
.
. what ' s great about this film is that it is made as if holding up a mirror to life
. it reflects reality
.
and that ' s why it makes such an impact
. edward zwick hasnt created a clever
, well written
and terrifying thriller that may very well be one of the best films of the season
. the director manages to tell several stories simultaneously
.
and so his film plays on sevral levels
, never loosing focuse on its main objective
. he isnt exploring hte abuse of power
, tyhe distrustful relationships that exist betweeen various segments ofthe the u
. s
. governement
( the army
, hte fbi
,
and the cia
)
. he takes a look at the complexities inherent when so many secrets
and lies are involved
. the palestinian community in 1998 newyorker york is treated exactly as japanese americans weere during world war ii
. there are concentration camps
and unlawful interments
, all in the name of tyhe
" greater good
.
" in the latter part of yhe film the land of opportunities looses its heart
and soul
-
- freedom
. was that what tje terror
! ists raelly wanted
? this film has evoked protests
and objections from the arab
- american poulation in the u
. s
.
anbd n
. y
. especially
.
but tothe me these protests seem unnecessary
. zwick is careful to not step over the line
and make the palistinians typical hollywood bad guys
. yhe scirpt is therefore wonderfully balanced
. agent hubbard ' s best freind
and loyal colleague frank haddad
( tony shalhoub
) is lebanese
- american
.
and it is qtuie often you hear lines such as
" my first boyfriend was palestinian
. they seduce you with their suffering
" or
" they love htis country as much as we do
.
"
but no marter how you twist this matter
, you won ' t get away from hte fact that when it comes to world wide terrorism it is arab
- speaking poplation who are in the great majority
. more to the point
, hte siege demonstrates teh injustice of blanket condemnation ofthe any ethnic group by depicting the unfair treatment ofthe all arab
- americans by the u
. s
. military
.
annd thus thsi film does not serve as a source for discimenation in any
! way
. denzel washington is dashing as always
. infront this role he is much moreso determined
and stronger than usual
. anette bening is enjoyable
and believeable as a shadowy cia operative who prefers espionage
, a network ofthe snitches
and seduction to gather informtion
.
. bruce willis is terrifying as the sadist
, hungry for pwoer
, that never looses his conection with the audience
, sicne his point of veiw is not too hard to understand
. the film is elegantly shaped
. the scenes are easily floating into each other
and the film never seems overlong
. zwick knows exactly how to provoke tension
, horror
and emotions
and does it with a rarely observed professionalism
. he tightens the intensity as the events progress
.
and when a plot twist comes
, it actually is suprising
. it is not a film drained in patriotism
, like the work ofthe roland emerich
. nor is it a film tht portrays explosions purely forthe entertainment values
. it is a daring picture that has courage enough tothe undertake such a risky stroy
and difficult journey
. it has curage anough tothe git involved infront politics
. it questions our foreign policies
, mentality
and defense
. i must admit that it ends rather disappointing
, as the director turns thte patriotism way up
anbd innovation down
.
but despite of that
, it is certainly an intelligent
and thrilling film that provokes emotions
and thoughts
; a virtue that few summer films can boast ofthe
.
" tihs is the u
. s
. army
. it ' s a broadsword
, not a scalpel
. believe me
, you do nto want us in an american city
