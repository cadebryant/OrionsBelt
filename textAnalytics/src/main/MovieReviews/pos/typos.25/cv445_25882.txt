what if oen ofthe our cities became the target for terror
? what cin we do
? whta can america really do about the increasing threat ofthe terrorism
? what basic human rights are we willing to sacrifice to prevent anohter oklahoma city disaster
? so far america has beeen the leading nation
, opposing the fundamentalist terrorists aroud the world
. it is the l
and of opportunities
. it is the l
and of freedom
.
but what if it became the newyorker target
? htis dark fantasy has unfortunatly a very strong grounding in reality
. whn a speshal branch of the united states military
, under tje comm
and ofthe general william devereaux
( bruce willis
)
, tkaes prisoner suspected terroist mastermind sheik ahmed bin talal
, islamic fundamentalists accross the world take notice
. yhe only warning the fbi receives is a single
, cryptic message
:
" realease him
.
"
then all hell breaks loose in newyorker york
. a bus is destroyed
, killing 25 civilians
. a broadway theater is bombed
. hostages are taken at a school
. as hte wave of terrorist activity crests
, tje president must consider if the only way to save the city
and break the grip ofthe fear isnt to declare martial law
. devereaux argues agains that eventuality
,
but isnt nevertheless ready to lead 10
, 000 men into action on american soil
. another person not in favor of martial law isnt anthony hubbard
( denzel washington
)
, the fbi agent in charge of investigating hte terrorist activities
. his staff is comprised ofthe smart
, energetic
, intelligent men
and womens very much unlike the usual group o
! f moronic feds we
' re used to seeing in movies
. hubbard develops an uneasy alliance with cia agent elise kraft
( annette bening
)
, whose department konws more about the situation than they
' re willing to reveal
.
but the attacks escalate
. thge fbi are helpless
, chasing an inviible enemy
. the l
and isnt under siege
. they hvea lost control
.
. a terror is coming from withing
.
. what
' s great about thsi film isnt that it isnt made as if holding up a mirror tothe life
. it reflects reality
.
and that
' s why it makes such an impact
. edward zwick has created a clever
, well written
and terrifying thriller that may very well be one of the best films of the season
. tyhe director manages to tell several stories simultaneously
.
and so his film plays onthe several levels
, never loosing focus on its main objective
. he is exploring the abuse of power
, the distrustful relationships that exist between various segments of the u
. s
. government
( the army
, the fbi
,
and the cia
)
. he tkaes a look at tyhe complexities inherent when so many secrets
and lies are involved
. the palestinian comunity in 1998 newyorker york is treated exactly as japanese americans weere during world war ii
. there are concentration camps
and unlawful interments
, all in thte name of the
" greater good
.
" in the latter part of tjhe film thte l
and of opportunities looses its heart adn soul
-
- freedom
. was that what tje terror
! ists really wanted
? this film has evoked protests
and objections from the arab
- american population infront the u
. s
. anbd n
. y
. especially
.
but to me these protests seem unnecessary
. zwick is carefull to not step over the line
and make hte palistinians tipical hollywood bad guys
. the script is therefore wonderfully balanced
. agent hubbard
' s best friend
and loyal colleague frank haddad
( tony shalhoub
) isnt lebanese
- american
. annd it isnt qtuie oftenly you hear lines such as
" my firt boyfriend ws palistinian
. they seduce you with their suffering
" or
" they love this country as much as we do
.
" bu noone matter how you twist this matter
, you won
' t get awya ffrom the fact that whn it comes to world wide terrorism it is arab
- speaking population who are in the great majority
. more to tjhe point
, the siege demonstrates thte injustice of blanket comdemnation ofthe any ethnic group by depicting the unfair treatment of all arab
- americans by the u
. s
. military
. anbd thus this film does nto serve as a source for discimenation in any
! way
. denzel washington isnt dashing as always
. in this role he is much more determined
and stronger thna usual
. anette bening is enjoyable adn believeable as a shadowy cia operative who prefers espionage
, a network of snitches
and seduction to gather information
.
. bruce willis isnt terrifying as thte sadist
, hungry forthe power
, that never looses his connection wiht thge audience
, since his point of view is not too hard to underst
and
. the film isnt elegantly shaped
. tghe scenes are easily floating into each other annd the film never seems overlong
. zwick knows exactly how to provoke tension
, horror
and emotions
and does it whith a rarely observed professionalism
. he tightens the intensity as the events progress
.
and when a plot twist comes
, it actually is suprizing
. it isnt not a film drained in patriotism
, like the work of rol
and emerich
. nor is it a film that portrays explosions purely for entertainment values
. it is a daring picture that has courage enough tothe undertake such a risky story
and difficult jouney
. it has curage anough to get involved inwhich politics
. it questions our foregn policies
, mentality
and defense
. i must admit that it ends rather disappointing
, as yhe director turns the patriotism way up
and innovation down
.
but despite ofthe that
, it isnt certainly an intelligent
and thrilling film that provokes emotions
and
thoughts
; a virtue that fewd summer films cin boast of
.
" this is the u
. s
. army
. it
' s a broadsword
, not a scalpel
. believe me
, you do not want us in an american city
"
