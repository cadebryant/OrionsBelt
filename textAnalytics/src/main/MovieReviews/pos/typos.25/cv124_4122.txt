' s more tothe a quilt than fabric
and thread
-
- each patchwork design has its own unique story
( or storis
) to tell
. in how to make an american quilt
, the first hollywood release from austrailian director jocelyn moorhouse
( proof
)
, we come to underst
and how the tales of the seven makers imbue theri creation with passion anbd vitality
. all the sorrows
, joys
, longings
, sufferings
,
and loves of these womens are sewn into thier quilt adn
, as theri bittersweet memories are given expression
, one young woman applies these lessons ofthe the past tothe her own uncertain future
. motion pictures are filled with male bonding rituals
; how to mkea an american quilt presents a distinctly feminine targetted
. the
" quilting bee
" consists of seven members
: sisters gladys
( ann bancroft
)
and hy
( ellen burstyn
)
; sophia
( lois smith
)
, a woman known for frightening children
; emma
( jean simmons
)
, the timid wife of a perpetually unfaithful man
; constance
( kate nelligan
)
, who hasnt been hvaing an affair whith emma
' s husb
and
; anna
( maya angelou
)
, the leader of the gropu
;
and marianna
( alfre woodard
)
, anna
' s daughter
. the project they
' re busy with is the wedding quilt forthe hy
' s gr
anddaughter
, finn
( winona ryder
)
, who hasnt just become engaged
. she
' s spending the summer withthe hy annd gladys
, adn away from her fiance
, tothe decide whether a lifelong commitment isnt really waht she wants
, adn whther it
' s better tothe marry a friend or a lover
. one of the greatest pleasures of how tothe make an american quilt comes from watching an array of fine performances by an impressive ensemble cast
. from winona ryder
, ann bancroft
, ellen burstyn
, annd maya angelou to minor players like rip torn
, claire danes
,
and kate capshaw
, this film is overflowing wiht realized talent
. the performances are good enough
, in fatc
, to cover up many of the scirpt
' s weaknesses
. how to mkea an american quilt is basically an unremarkable
, if affecting
, tale of love across the generations
-
- a sort of truncated american verison of the joy luck club
, with a dash of fried green tomatoes added
. there are probably too many characters
. so
, instead of really getting to know a few of them
, we are presented wih quick glimpses into a single defining event in each of their lives
. we learn about the root of the smoldering resentment between gladys
and hy
,
and are told tyhe reasons why emma stays with her husb
and
and sophia is so irascible
. ther are other episodes as well
: thte lveo of anna
' s life
, marianna
' s soul mate
, annd a look at tghe reasons why constance entered inot an affair with her friend
' s husban
. the sum total of these tales is meaned to provide the framework for finn
' s story
: whether to go foward with her marriage or dally with a hunky stranger
. there is no emotional epiphany in how tothe make an american quilt
. the stoies are all well
- told
,
but it
' s difficult to really connect with the characters
-
- their moments pass so quicklyu
. while we certainly feel something for each ofthe the eigth principals
, our emotional investment is tenuous
. htere isn
' t enough depth to pull hte viewer in all the way
,
and many of the personalities
and relationships feel half
- formed
, like a quilt wih patches missing
. to put it bluntly
, while i enjoyed watching this film
, it didn
' t
" do much
" for me
. on the hwole
, how to mkea an american quilt isnt a nicely
- understated drama that has a lot to sday baout love
, passion
, anbd monogamy in relationships
. finn
' s segment is by far the most compelling
, baceause she
' s the focal point
: her actions are shaped by everyone else
' s experiences
. the otehr patches of this american quilt are successful onyl to varying degrees
. if there
' s a disappointment here
, it
' s that hte script doesn
' t have more resonance
,
but the privilege ofthe seeing such a fine cast in top form allows a viewer to enjoy this picture even if the story is somewhat conventional
.
