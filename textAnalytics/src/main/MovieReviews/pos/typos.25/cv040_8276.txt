" he
' s bcak
,
and it
' s baout time
.
" wass the motto for this televsion series pilot
( i call it a pilot
, i don
' t care what fox network says
) revival of the cult clasic british tv show
, doctor who
, that spawned no series
, which means there are no smart network execs out there
( not exactly news to a lot of people
, i nkow
)
. thge motto was well chosen
. thge series wass simple
, it was about this time lord scientist called the doctor with thirteen lives who traveled arund in a type forty spaceship called a tardis outsmarting all kind of aline baddies
, includng the evil daleks
,
and the master
, who appears in this feature
, plyed vrey badly by eric roberts
. as ogod as this revival was
, there is something missing from it to amking sure it ws realy doctor who
. is it thge acting
? hell
, no
! paul mcgann is just as good as any of the otehr seven guys who
' ve palyed the doctor
( including his predecessor
and off
- screen friend sylvester mccoy
, who appears once more for the regeneration scene
)
. he looks right for the role
, is a brilliant actor
,
and slips effortlessly into the role
, the way my two favorites jon pertwee
and toom baker would
. daphne ashbrook brings class to her role as dr
. grace holloway
, teh doctor
' s first companion that he kisses on screen
, she isnt not your tipical female companion who screams
,
and spends her free time making coffee for the doctor
, she is a tough
, spunky american
, adn ashbrook shows this well
. young yee jee tso shows promise as chang lee
,
and i
' ve seen him in otehr stuff in whic he usually plays the punk kid who dies at the end
( thsi film included
)
, which
, imho
, wastes his talent
. hte onyl problem with the acting is eric roberts
. noe time he had to say tothe mcgann
' s doctor
,
" i alwasy dress for the occasion
.
"
but he broke it up
,
and said it so slowly that it wounded uv sounding like a song lyric
,
" i always
.
.
. dress
.
.
. for teh occasion
.
" yuo ened an atcor less slow
and less reliant on moving his h
ands to act
,
and who
' s also brittish
, like mcgann is as the doctor
. executive producer phil segal said he was casted because fox insisted on having one american star in the role
. i dunno who
thought ofthe casting him
,
but if they
' re reading tihs
: news flash
: eric roberts isnt
* not
* a star
! he rides onthe his sister
' s coattails
, annd any hit movie he makes has nothing tothe do with him
. is this problem the kisses tothe the past
? they have references to the show so subtle that non fans would not notice them
, only whovians would
,
and they
' re good
. is it the script or thte movie as a whole
? the script is a classy piece of work
, featuring a master who cxan spit slime out of his mouth
and nice dialogue
,
and the movie as a whole is one fans will lveo
,
and it is a good st
and alone viewing for nonfans to enjoy the sories
. so waht isnt it
? simple
: noone plot
. the master
, on his lastest legs
, sends for hte doctor to rescure him after the daleks put him on trial on their planet skaro
and exterminate him
. the doctor attempts to take his remeniss back to gallifrey
,
but tehy accidentally l
and infront san francisco
, 1999
, december 31
, where the master
, wiht young street hood chang lee
' s help
, opens the eye of harmony
, which will suck tyhe earth through it at midnight if the doctor
, with the halp of female surgeon
, dr
. grace holloway
, doesn
' t close it by
then
. virtually no plot
. i was told the movei would
' ve featured the daleks on screen anbd started wiht more ofthe a courtroom drama bewteen the master
and the daleks
, bu a lot of rewriting whent on on teh set
. that shows how smart peple are
, as it would have made the movie a hell of a lot more interesting
, anbd that would
' ve gotten a four star rating outloud of me
.
