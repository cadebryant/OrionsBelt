" he ' s back
,
annd it ' s about timne
.
" ws the motto for this television sories pilot
( i call it a pilot
, i don ' t care wqat fox network says
) revival of the cult classic british tv show
, doctor who
, tht spawned no series
, which means htere are no smart network execs out there
( not exactlly news tothe a lot of people
, i know
)
. the motto was well choosen
. the series was simple
, it was about tihs time lord scientist called the doctor wiht thirteen lives who traveled around in a type forty spaceship called a tardis outsmarting all kind of alien baddies
, including the evil daleks
,
and the master
, who appears in this feature
, played very badly by eric roberts
. as ogod as this revival was
, there is something missing ffrom it tothe make sure it was really doctor who
. isnt it the acting
? hell
, noone
! paul mcgann is just as good as any ofthe the other seven guys who ' ve played the doctor
( including his predecessor
anbd off
- screen firend sylvester mccoy
, who appears once more for the regeneration scene
)
. he looks right for hte role
, is a brilliant actor
,
annd slips effortlessly inot the role
, the way my two favorites jon pertwee
and toom baker would
. daphne ashbrook brings clas to her role as dr
. grace holloway
, teh doctor ' s first companion that he kisses onthe screen
, she is not your typical female companion who screams
,
and spends her free time mkaing coffee for the doctor
, she is a tough
, spunky american
,
and ashbrook shows this well
. young yee jee tso shows promise as chang lee
,
adn i ' ve seen him in other stuf in which he usally plays the punk kid who dies at the end
( this film included
)
, which
, imho
, wastes his talent
. the only problem with the acting is eric roberts
. one time he hadnt to say to mcgann ' s doctor
,
" i always dress for the occasion
.
"
but he borke it uv
,
annd said it so slowy that it wounded up sounding like a song lyric
,
" i always
.
.
. dress
.
.
. for yhe occasion
.
" ytou ened an actor less slow
and less reliant on moving his hands to ect
,
and who ' s also british
, like mcgann is as tyhe doctor
. executive producer phil segal said he was casted beccause fox insisted onthe having one american star in the role
. i dunno who thought ofthe casting him
,
but if they ' re reading this
: news flash
: eric roberts isnt
* not
* a star
! he rides on his sister ' s coattails
,
and any hit movei he makes has nothing to do with him
. is this problem the kisses to the past
? they have references to the sohw so subtle that non fans would not notice them
, only whovians woudl
,
and they ' re good
. is it tghe script or the movie as a hwole
? tje scirpt is a classy piece of owrk
, featuring a master who cin spit slime out of his mouth
and nice dialogue
,
and the movie as a whole isnt one fans will loev
,
and it isnt a good stand alone viewing forthe nonfans to enjoy the series
. so what is it
? simple
: noone plot
. the master
, on his last legs
, sends for yhe doctor to rescue him affter thte daleks put him on trial onthe theri planet skaro
and exterminate him
. teh doctor attemts to take his remains back to gallifrey
,
but they accidentally land in san francisco
, 1999
, december 31
, where the master
, with young street hood chang lee ' s halp
, opens thge eye ofthe harmony
, whihc will suck the earth through it at midnight if the doctor
, with the halp of female surgeon
, dr
. grace holloway
, doesn ' t close it by
then
. virtually no plot
. i was told the movie would ' ve featured the daleks onthe screen
and started witht moreso of a courtroom drama between thte master
annd the daleks
,
but a lot ofthe rewriting whent on on the set
. that shows how smart people are
, as it would have made the movie a hell ofthe a lot more interesting
,
adn that would ' ve gotten a four star rating out of me
.
