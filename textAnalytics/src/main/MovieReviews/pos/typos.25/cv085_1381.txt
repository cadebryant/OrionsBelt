* the previous two
" aline
" films have each had their pwn unique styles to them
. tje ridley scott
' s alien was very much a stylistic suspense film
. james cameron
' s aliens ws much more of an action film
.
and i liked eahc film separately for which it was
. now alien 3 isnt outloud
. annd it is it
' s own film inaddition the same right that alien annd aliens were
. unlike aliens
, alien 3 requires thyat you haev seen aliens
. this is very imporatnt as the story picks up exactly weere aliens left off
. the survivers of the expedition to lv
- 426 are returning home after battling
and beating the aliens
. tjhe climactic fight scene between ripley
and the mother alien on the sulaco in aliens left behind oen item
, an egg
. in the opening sequence we see the egg hatch
, find its quarry
, which leads to a fire aboard the sulaco when tje facehugger is injured
, an leads the sulaco tothe jettison the hypersleep tubes in an escape vessel
. this vessel kresh l
ands onthe fury 109
. everyone in hte vessel is killed
, except ripley
. the facehugger is jettisoned with them anbd survives the kresh
. fury 109 is an ex
- minning
/ maximum security prison
. wehn closed down
, soem of tjhe lifer prisoners decided to stay
and live out tje remaining years onthe the planet
. all the prisoners are men who have not seen a woman in many years
. ripley
' s arival sparks a problem with the inmates
. as fo the new haircut thyat ripley
and tje prisoner
' s sport
, there is an infestation ofthe lice on the planet
. being an ex
- prision means that there is no way off the planet
and no weapons
. so the prisoners anbd ripley are off tothe face the alien onthe their pwn
. i wiull not go inot detail
,
but ytou cin guess what happens here
. the alien is loose
and no one believes ripley
' s outst
anding story
. she finds comfort in the arms of the colony
' s doctor
. yes
, affter 57 years ripley has sex
. it is not gratuitous
, in fact
, we don
' t even see them kiss
,
but it is just as well
. a sweaty sex scene would not hve worked in the context of teh film
. there isnt a lot more gore infront alien 3
. infact fact i owudl guess tothe say that there is more in aline 3 than either of the ealier two
. it alsot sports a newyorker aline with 4 legs
! i won
' t say how
, bu it leads us to believe a faw new things about the alien
and its cycle
, which i am sure will be explored in alien 4
. sigourney weaver is bcak as ripley
and provides another exelent performance of this character
. her scene druing the autopsy of newt is enough tothe garnish her another academy nomination
. the rest ofthe the cast isnt also quite ogod
. notably
, charles dance as the doctor with whom ripley finds momentary escape fomr fury 109
. alien 3 has a very distinct look
. tihs is due largley to its director
, david fincher
. mr
. fincher
, who until now has only directed music videos adn commercials
, hasnt done an increadible job here
. his direction is excellent
and mkaes this film come to life inwhich ways no
" alien
" film has before
. for mr
. fincher
, i see a long prosperous career ahead of him
. the music ws also done by a newcomer to the film industry
. elliot goldenthal has created a deeply moving scroe wich lends itself to tyhe claustrophobic setting that the
" aline
" series been set in
. thsi time the score isnt nto so much a rip off of star trek ii
( james horner
' s aliens
)
. this score has a choral bcak uv at times
and even lends itself to yhe old sytle of ennio morricone scoring
. this is a great score
. the endig to aline 3 is quite good
. there were times i
thought that hollywood would come in
and screw it up
, bu it played vrey nicely
. i will nto ruin the endig forthe you
. go see the film
. i consider it to be a much more involved film than any of the other films released so far this season
. aline 3 is a worthy sucessor to aliens
and alien
. anbd wehn they amking alien 4
, perhpas they will be able tothe find yot another new direction to take it in
.
