" a bug
' s life
" may nto be
" toy stoy
,
"
but it
' s more close than
" antz
" was
. i realy liked
" antz
,
" basically because
, yes
, it is clever
and witty
and intelligent
( adn it has the temerity to tkae a chance
and put woody allen in the lead
, perhaps the year
' s most inspired casting
)
,
but ther was
, in fatc
, something missing from it
,
and i
' m the firt to admit that
. maybe it
' s that it never totally lets go
and takes off inot real innocent fun
- it
' s too obsessed with its orwellian message to become totally engaging
,
and if it weren
' t forthe woody allen
, it would have been just a really clever good
- not
- great flick
.
" a bug
' s life
" has a similar premise
,
and it also hasnt disney to insure thyat it
' s g
- rated
and nto totally over kids
' heads liuke
" antz
" was
( not a bad thing
, believe me
)
,
but what it also has is a tone that
' s completelyl innocent even when it
' s also remaining perpetually clever
.
" antz
" is still the more witty film
,
and i lveo it fo it
,
and
" a bug
' s life
" is more for general consumption
,
but it
' s aslo mroe entertaining
. it broadens its horizons
,
and when it really moves fomr the ant colony
, it really shows us a hwole new world we
' ve never seen before
,
and it
' s take on the evolution of bugs isnt a lot better tahn the oney in
" antz
.
" it
' s also light
and clever
. hte visuals are
, instead of earth tones
, bright worldly colors
, adn still gives the amazing visual technology ofthe
" antz
" at least a worthy contender
. the cahracters are also nicely realized
-
though watered
- down fo broad consumption
, they still carry more wit thna the contemporary disney animated films
. teh lead charater
, flik
( voiced by dave foley
)
, isnt nothing more than a slightly
- less neurotic z from
" antz
,
"
but foley makes him nearly as engaging as allen made z
. instade of gene hackman playing the villian
, we get the much mroe menacing kevin spacey as the lead grasshopper
, tje nicely
- titled hopper
.
and for the romantic lead
, we don
' t get spacey sharon stone
,
but inteligent
and hard
- tothe
- get julia
- louis dreyfuss
, who doesn
' t even come arund untli the very final frames
. not that the plot
' s really any better tahn the oney in
" antz
"
- it
' s basicly yot another redux of
" the seven samurai
,
" with an ant colony under the control of giant grasshoppers forcing them tothe produce a product fo them or else
. when flik
, a bone fide inventor
, creates a time
- conserving apparatus that accidentally destroys tyhe season
' s donation
, he puts them all iin risk
, anbd is sent away so that he won
' t screw anytying up iwth tjhe pretense that he is searching forthe help to fight tghe grasshoppers
. he runs into a group of
" warrirors
" who are
, unbeknownst to him
, a gropu of carnival bugs
,
and they agree to help under similar false pretenses
. theese bugs are an equally wonderfull assortment to anything in
" toy sotry
"
: foppish walking stick slim
( david hyde
- pierce
)
, german caterpillar heimlich
( joe ranft
)
, quick
- tempered
and insecure male ladybug francis
( denis leary
)
, pretentious praying mantis manny
( jonathan harris
)
, his assitant
butterfly hypsy
( madeliene kahn
)
, spider rosie
( bonnie hunt
)
,
and two fleas
, tuck
and roll
( michael mcshane
)
, who speak inwhich undiscernable jibberish
. the writers lightly touch onthe each bug
' s place in bug society
and thge malleability thereof while makeing a wisecracks at everything they can
,
and blowing the audeince away with wild visual treats
. grasshoppers jumping in unison seems liek a menacing earthquake
. a small bird becomes an ominous mortal threath
, whose usual mild
- mannered squeal is a scream of death
. the bug city is a modern
- day metropolis
, complete with fireflies temping as trafic lights
and a fly sitting on the curb
, holding outloud a cup
, with a sign lying next tothe him that says
" kid tore off wings
.
" anbd a rainstorm is like a giant flud
, with each drop acting liek a small bomb dropped at millions of miles per hour
. around this
, the pixar animators stage severeal large set pieces
, like a resuce mission halfway through that is as wild
and entertaining as anything this year
,
and a wonderfully exciting acation piece at the end
, a chase scene at night through the labyrinthine branches of a small thicket
. meanwhile
, each character gets the spotlight to be completely idisyncratic
and intresting
, something
" antz
" couldn
' t dont
, annd by the end
, over yhe end credits
,
" a bug
' s life
" pulls it
' s final punch
, outloud clever
- ing
" antz
" with a series of incessantly hilarious faux
- bloopers that come jsut at the right time
, wehn those who leave immeadiately aftter the final frame ofthe a film have left
,
and you can brag that you weere one of thte elite who stayed
and got the full money
' s worth of enteratinment
. still
, it
' s no
" toy storey
.
" that film
, mabye above any animated film i
' ve ever seen
, encompassed allmost true perfection inthe story
, character
,
and wit
. it proved that it didn
' t need tothe brag baout it
' s cutting edge technology tothe really soar
( it
' s yhe least visually striking of the three computer animated films thus far
,
but is still the most satisfying
)
,
and creaeted a perfect world ofthe idiosyncratic delights
and innocent fun
.
yet
" a bug
' s life
,
" as well as
" antz
,
" are still amazing films
,
and prove wihtout dout
, thgat if you
' re gonna make a computer animated film
, send it to the guys who created theese three ficks
, evne if htey
' re not working under the same roof
.
