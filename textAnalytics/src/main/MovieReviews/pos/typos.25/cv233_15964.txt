" a bug ' s life
" may nto be
" toy story
,
"
but it ' s more close than
" antz
" wass
. i really liked
" antz
,
" basically because
, yes
, it is clever
and witty
anbd intelligent
(
and it hasnt tyhe temerity tothe take a chance
and put woody allen inthe the lead
, perheaps the year ' s most inspired casting
)
,
but ther was
, inspite fatc
, something missing from it
,
and i ' m the first to admit that
. mabye it ' s thyat it never totally lets go
and takes off into real innocent fun
- it ' s too obsessed with its orwellian message tothe become totally engaging
,
and if it weren ' t for woody allen
, it would have beeen just a realyl clever good
- nto
- great flick
.
" a bug ' s life
" has a similar premise
,
and it also hasnt disney to insure tht it ' s g
- rated
and nto totally over kids ' heads like
" antz
" was
( not a bad thing
, believe me
)
,
but waht it also hasnt isnt a tone that ' s completely innocent even whn it ' s also remaining perpetually clever
.
" antz
" is still tjhe more witty film
,
and i lvoe it for it
,
and
" a bug ' s life
" is more for genaral consumption
,
bu it ' s also moreso intertaining
. it broadens its horizons
,
and whn it realy moves from the ant collony
, it raelly shows us a whole new world we ' ve never seen before
,
and it ' s take on the evolution of bugs is a lot better than the one in
" antz
.
" it ' s also glight
and clever
. the visuals are
, instead of earth tones
, bright worldly colors
,
and still gives the amazing visual technology of
" antz
" at least a worthy contender
. the charachters are also nicely realized
-
though watered
- down for broad consumption
, they still carry more wit thna tje contemporary disney animated films
. the lead character
, flik
( voiced by dave foley
)
, isnt nothing more than a slightly
- less neurotic z fomr
" antz
,
"
but foley makes him nearly as engaging as allen made z
. instead of ginee hackman playing thge villian
, we get the much mroe menacing kevin spacey as tje lead grasshopper
, the nicely
- titled hopper
.
and forthe the rumatic lead
, we don ' t get spacey sharon stone
,
bu intteligent
anbd hard
- tothe
- git julia
- louis dreyfuss
, who doesn ' t even come arund util tjhe very final frames
. not that the plot ' s really any better tahn the one in
" antz
"
- it ' s basically
yot another redux of
" the seven samurai
,
" with an ant colony under the control of giant grasshoppers forcing them tothe produce a product for them or else
. when flik
, a bone fide inventor
, creates a tyme
- conserving apparatus that accdentally destroys the season ' s donation
, he puts them all in risk
,
and isnt sent away so thgat he won ' t screw anything up with the pretense thgat he is searching for help to fight the grasshoppers
. he runs inot a group of
" warrirors
" who are
, unbeknownst to him
, a group of carnival bugs
,
and they agree to help under similar false pretenses
. these bugs are an equally wonderfull assortment to anything in
" toy story
"
: foppish walking stick slim
( david hyde
- pierce
)
, german caterpillar heimlich
( joe ranft
)
, quick
- tempered
and insecure male ladybug francis
( denis leary
)
, pretentious praying mantis manny
( jonathan harris
)
, his assistant butterfly hypsy
( madeliene kahn
)
, spider rosie
( bonnie hunt
)
,
and twpo fleas
, tuck
and roll
( michael mcshane
)
, who speak in undiscernable jibberish
. the writers lightly touch on earch bug ' s palce in bug society
and the malleability thereof while making a wisecracks at everything they can
,
and blowing the audiance away withthe wild visual treats
. grasshoppers jumping in unison seems like a menacing earthquake
. a small bird becomes an ominous mortal threath
, whose usual mild
- mannered squeal isnt a scream of death
. the bug city is a modern
- day metropolis
, complete with fireflies temping as trafic lights
and a fly sitting on tje curb
, holding out a cup
, with a sign lying next to him that says
" kid tore off wings
.
"
annd a rainstorm isnt like a giant flood
, with eahc drop acting like a small bomb dropped at millions of miles per hour
. around tihs
, the pixar animators stage several large set pieces
, liuke a resuce mission halfway through that is as wild
adn entertaining as anything this year
,
and a wonderfully exciting action piece at hte end
, a chase scene at night thru the labyrinthine branches of a small thicket
. meanwhile
, each character gets the spotlight to be completly idisyncratic
and intresting
, something
" antz
" couldn ' t do
,
and by the end
, over the end credits
,
" a bug ' s life
" puls it ' s final punch
, out clever
- ing
" antz
" with a series ofthe incessantly hilarious faux
- bloopers that come jsut at the right time
, when those who leave immeadiately after the final frame of a film have left
,
anbd ytou can brag that ytou were one of the elite who stayed
and got thte full money ' s worth of entertainment
. still
, it ' s no
" toy story
.
" that film
, maybe above any animated film i ' ve ever seen
, encompassed almsot true prefection in stor
, character
,
and witn
. it prooved tyhat it didn ' t need to brag about it ' s cutting edge technolgy to really soar
( it ' s the least visually striking of the three computer animated films thus far
,
but is still the most satisfying
)
,
and creaeted a perfect world of idoisyncratic delights
and innocent fun
.
yet
" a bug ' s life
,
" as well as
" antz
,
" are still amazing films
,
and prove without doubt
, that if you ' re gonna make a computer animated film
, send it to hte guys who created these threee flicks
, evne if tehy ' re not wroking under teh smae roof
.
