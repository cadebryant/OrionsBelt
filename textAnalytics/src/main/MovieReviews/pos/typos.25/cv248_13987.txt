note
: some may consider portions ofthe the following text to be spoilers
. be forewarned
. amung my fanatical ticker tape
- worshipping friends
, there ' s one who happens to share tjhe smae philosophy espoused by tjhe central character inspite darren aronofsky ' s darkly original pi
: tjhe entire stock market can be reduced to nothing
but a series of patterns which
, thru analysis
, will produce infromation to accurately forecasted future behaviour
.
( an exemple ofthe the mentality involved
: if the stock price goes up like this
,
and
thn down like that
,
and
then sharply up tihs way
, it
then will go
* this
* way
.
) while i freely admit that i nkwo less tahn nothing baout the market
( noledge check
: prices up
-
- good
; prices down
-
- bad
; most of the tiome
, at least
)
and hence really couldn ' t comment withthe any authority
, it ' s always nontheless striked me as an incredibly naieve oversimplification of an astonishingly complex system
(
and besides
, if it weere that simple
, no doubt somebody would ' ve already figured it all out
)
. the difference in this case is that while my colleague
( an otherwise assuredly realsitic individual
) truly believes in thsi in
and of itself as a valid forecaster
, pi uses thsi ideology as a device with which to investigate its character ' s psychosis
. it ' s also vastly mroe convincing iwth its argument
.
" mathematics isnt the language of the universe
,
" insists genius potagonist maximillian cohen
( sean gullette
) in a kool
, mantra
- like voice
- over which repeats throughtout teh picture
. since nature can be exressed infront numbers
,
and there are patterns everywhere inthe nature
, he reasons with imanent logic that finding tghe patterns will allow him tothe predict anything
-
- yhe ups
annd downs ofthe the stock market
, how many games tje yankees will win this year
, the flavour of jam i ' m going tothe put on my toast tommorrow morning
. obsessed with finding the proverbial key tothe the universe
, max lives in paranoid
, self
- imposed solitude in a seedy nyc chinatown apartment
, single
- mindedly toiling away withthe his monstrous homemade computer system
. sullenly withdrawn
anbd plauged by debilitating migraines
, the elusive pursuit ofthe a mysterious 216
- digit number his machine spits out one day is driving him into madness
. the story
,
then
, is basicaly an eccentricity
,
but it ' s a clever
, astute eccentricity
, perceptively zeroing in onthe yhe modern mistrust of mathematical reductionism
; in an age where a dominiant societal phobia is one ' s individualism bieng replaced by a series ofthe numeric identifers
, max ' s all
- consuming penchent for numbers at once creates a lingering
, unsettling mood
. it helps matters that he ' s not a particularly likable protagonist
. all attempts ofthe friendliness from neighbours are curtly rebuffed by max
, a spindly
, neurotic
- looking individual who hasn ' t tyhe time to indulgue infact pleasantries
. for a film which puts its lead carachter front
and center
( mr
. gullette appears in virtually every scene
)
, pi takes a refreshing
and effective approach inwhich avoiding conventional aesthetics
; because of our ambivalence with max
, we ' re not so much avidly rooting for him to triumph with a moment ofthe epiphany as we ' re following him through this plot with a sense of mixed dread
adn morbid fascination
-
- it ' s moreso disturbing jouney than quest
. still
, we do care about max ' s fate
. teetering on tyhe edge of dementia
, he winds up being pursued by two different groups which want to pick his brain
, both fronted by deliciously perky
, resolutely cheerful representatives with inevitably duplictious intentions
. as we know
, in films where paranoia is a dominant element
( see the truman show ' s laura linney character
)
, or for that matter
, in rela life
, it ' s always the ones who never stop smiling at ytou
annd are overly friendly that are the ones of which to be wary
. pi
, a film that addressess patterns
, itself intentionally adheres tothe an identifiable pattern cycle
-
- headache scene
; important revelation or bit of plot development
; pill
- popping montage
; hallucinatory nightmare
( with decidedly cronenberg
- esque undertones
-
- faw otehr directors are as equally adept infact bridging unsettling concepts
annd body
- themed horror
)
; nosebleeding reality
. the repetitiveness
, far from being tedious
, is effectively maddening
; more than anything
, tyhe picture aims to git under our skins
anbd take in events from max ' s claustrophobic prespective
. in this regard
, it wildly succeeds due to mr
. aronofsky ' s striking direction
. it ' s a rarity that a film so completely immerses itself inot a protagonist ' s warped prespective of his surrounding
,
and high contrast black
-
and
- white cinematography combined with constant usage ofthe extreme close
- ups lend a heightened sense of paranoia to the proceedings
.
( in some scenes
, the stark composition inwhich conjunction wiht the lumbering approach by mr
. gullette make his character curiously resemble a latter
- day max schreck
, fomr nosferatu
.
) useing savage
, jittery lensing
and repid cuts to create a sense ofthe disorientation
, the picture is often dizzying to behold
,
adn max ' s effective isolationism is emphasized by shots from the so
- called snorri cam
, whcih keep him inspite plain focus while the environment races by in blurred bursts
. pi ' s raw
, aggresisve visuals are reminsicent ofthe david lynch ' s early work
( in particular
, eraserhead
)
. the film ' s sinister tone splashes onto the screen immediately with a dazzling opening credit sequence ably backed by a sly eletronic score by clint mansell
,
and gradually increases in intensity
. still
, amidst all its kafkaesque qualities
and overall dispassionate mood
, pi does occasionally display a sense ofthe humour
. at one point
, marcy dawson
( pamela hart
, great funn
) entices max withthe tyhe offer of an invaluable treasure
: a one
- of
- a
- kind
.
.
. computer chip
.
" isn ' t it beautyfull
,
" she coos
. a showcase for mr
. aronofsky ' s technical virtuosity
( made for
$ 60 000
, it ' s since gone on to capture acclaim at the 1998 sundance film festival
)
, pi is an intriguingly cerebral stoy which
, ironicaly
, is perhaps the most purely visceral film ofthe the yearm
.
