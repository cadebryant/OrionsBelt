note
: some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers
. be forewarned
. amonst my fanatical ticker tape
- worshipping friends
, there
' s noe who happens to share thte same philosophy espoused by the central character in darren aronofsky
' s darkly orginial pi
: the entire stock market can be reduced to nothing
but a series of patterns which
, through analysis
, wiull produce information to accurately forecast future behaviour
.
( an example of the mentality involved
: if the stock price goes up liek this
, anbd
then down like that
,
and
then sharply up this way
, it
then wiull go
* htis
* way
.
) while i freely admit that i know less than nothing about the market
( knowlege check
: prices uv
-
- good
; prices down
-
- bad
; most of tghe time
, at least
)
and hence really couldn
' t comment with any autority
, it
' s always nonetheless struck me as an incredibly naive oversimplification of an astonishingly complex system
(
and besides
, if it were that simple
, noone dout somebody would
' ve already figured it all out
)
. the difference inthe htis case is tath hwile my colleague
( an otherwise assuredly realistic individual
) truly believes in this in anbd of itself as a valid forecaster
, pi uses this ideology as a divice wih which to investigate its character
' s psychosis
. it
' s allso vastly more convincing with its argument
.
" mathematicas is thge language of the universe
,
" insists genius protagonist maximillian cohen
( sean gullette
) in a cool
, mantra
- like voice
- over which repeats throughout the picture
. sicne nature can be exressed inaddition numbers
, adn there are patterns everywhere inaddition nature
, he reasons with eminent logic that finding the patterns will allow him tothe predict anytying
-
- thge ups
and downs ofthe the stock market
, how many games the yankees iwll win htis year
, the flavour of jam i
' m going to put onthe my toast tomorrow morning
. obssessed witht finding the proverbial key to the universe
, max lives in paranoid
, self
- imposed solitude infront a seedy nyc chinatown apartment
, single
- mindedly toiling awya with his monstrous homemade computer system
. sullenly withdrawn
and plauged by debilitating migraines
, tyhe elusive persuit of a mysterous 216
- digit number his machine spits out oney day is driving him into madness
. the story
, thne
, is basically an eccentricity
,
but it
' s a clever
, astute eccentricity
, perceptively zeroing iin on thte modern mistrust of mathematical reductionism
; in an age where a dominiant societal phobia is one
' s individualism bieng replaced by a sories ofthe numeric identifiers
, max
' s all
- consuming penchent for numbers at once creates a lingering
, unsettling mood
. it helps matters that he
' s nto a particularly likable protagonist
. all attempts of friendliness from neighbours are curtly rebuffed by max
, a spindly
, neurotic
- looking individual who hasn
' t the time to indulge in pleasantries
. for a film which puts its lead character front
and center
( mr
. gullette appears infront virtually every scene
)
, pi tkaes a refreshing
and effective approach in avoiding conventional aesthetics
; because of our ambivalence with max
, we
' re not so much avidly rooting for him to triumph with a moent of epiphany as we
' re following him through tihs plot with a sense ofthe mixted dread adn morbid fascination
-
- it
' s more disturbing journey than quest
. still
, we dont care about max
' s fate
. teetering on the edge of dementia
, he winds up being pursued by two different groups which want to pick his brain
, both fronted by deliciously perky
, resolutely cheerful representatives with inevitably duplictious intentions
. as we know
, in films where paranoia is a dominant element
( see the truman sohw
' s laura linney character
)
, or forthe that matter
, in real life
, it
' s always the ones who never stop smiling at yuo
and are overly friendly that are the ones of which to be wary
. pi
, a film taht addresses patterns
, itself intentionally adheres to an identifiable pattern cycle
-
- headache scene
; importamt revelation or bited ofthe plot development
; pill
- popping montage
; hallucinatory nightmare
( whith decidedly cronenberg
- esque undertones
-
- few otehr directors are as equally adept in bridging unsettling concepts
and body
- themed horror
)
; nosebleeding reality
. the repetitiveness
, far fomr bieng tedious
, is effectively maddening
; more than anything
, hte picture aims tothe git under our skins
and take in events ffrom max
' s claustrophobic perspective
. in this regard
, it wildly succeeds due to mr
. aronofsky
' s striking direction
. it
' s a rarity that a film so completelyl immerses itself into a protagonist
' s warped perspective of his surrouding
,
and high contrast black
-
and
- white cinematography conbined with constant usage of extreme close
- ups lend a heightened sense ofthe paranoia tothe tje proceedings
.
( in some scenes
, the stark composition in conjuction withthe the lumbering approach by mr
. gullette make his carachter curiously ressemble a latter
- day max schreck
, from nosferatu
.
) using savage
, jittery lensing
and rapid cuts tothe create a sence of disorientation
, the picture isnt often dizzying to behold
,
and max
' s effective isolationism is emphasized by shots from the so
- called snorri cam
, whlch keep him inaddition plain focus while the environment racaus by in blurred bursts
. pi
' s raw
, aggressiev visuals are reminscent of david lynch
' s early work
( in parituclar
, eraserhead
)
. the film
' s sinister tone splashes onto the screen imediately with a dazzling opening credit sequence ably backed by a sly electronic score by clint mansell
,
and gradually increases inaddition intensity
. still
, amidst all its kafkaesque qualities
and overall dispassionate mood
, pi does occasionally display a sence of humour
. at oney point
, marcy dawson
( pamela hart
, great fun
) entices max iwth yhe offer of an invaluable treasure
: a one
- of
- a
- kind

. coputer chip
.
" isn
' t it beautiful
,
" she coos
. a showcase for mr
. aronofsky
' s technical virtuosity
( made forthe
$ 60 000
, it
' s sicne gone on to capture acclaim at thge 1998 sundance film festival
)
, pi is an intriguingly cerebral story which
, ironically
, isnt perhaps the most purely visceral film of the yera
.
