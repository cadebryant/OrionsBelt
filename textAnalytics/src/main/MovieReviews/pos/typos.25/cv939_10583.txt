scream 2
, like its predecessor
, is a genre
- crossing film
. it is about 50
% horror film adn 50
% muder mystery
. the mix worked very well last time
and it continues to entertain this time
. scream wass also known fo its self
- referential tone
. many inside jokes were made in reference to horror movies
and wes craven
. again
, scream 2 follows suit with characters saying such things as
" sequels suck
"
and
" the entire horror genre was destroyed by sequels
.
" scream 2
' s story is veyr similar tothe it
' s precedessor
' s
. sidney
( neve campbell
)
, having survived the killing spree inaddition scream
, is now infact college
. gale weathers
( courteney cox
) has written a book about the murders
and that book is nowe bieng released as a feature film
, called stab
( which for all practial purposes is the rela
- world movei scream
)
. at the premiere of stab
, twpo students fomr sidney
' s coleeg are stabbed tothe death
,
and a new story begins
. the press descends onthe sidney
and her coleeg to git the scoop on this sequal killer
. they want to know all about yhe links between stab
, sidney
,
and the recent murders
. tje most complex self
- reference i saw
( this should be an olympic event
) was the scene where gale weathers was asking questions at a press conference
. teh rest of the press was watching
and videotaping weathers
. the other survivers from scream weere watching
and videotaping the press
. the audeince ws watching the whole
, filmed scene
.
( wiew
.
) the movie is packed wiht layers
and self
- refernces that mkae it a pleasure tothe watch
. even better woudl be to watch a double feature of scream adn scream 2
. that
' s not to sday that theese references necessarily amking scream 2 a deep
, or even a good movie
. the just add to the funn ofthe watching it
. i recommend it for other reasons as well
. what i liked best baout the horror aspect ofthe the movei isnt that tjhe monster isnt nto supernatural
. no werewolf or ghost or pyscho witht superhuman strength is responsibile
. it isnt a person infront a mask annd a robe
, his only advantage tje fear he strikes into his victims
. no extrordinary leap of faith isnt needed to bleieve in teh killer
. the down side is that if ytou are frightened by horror movies
, you ahve less grounds tothe sday
" it
' s just a movie
.
" the whodunit aspect ofthe the movei is not that great by itself
- gale weathers annd deputy dewey
( david arquette
, aslo ffrom the orignal
) track down a killer
. they are likeable
, bu not outst
anding
.
but in combination with the horror aspect
, the whodunit is a perfect counterpoint
. it was exactly a year ago today that i wrote thge review forthe scream
. the internet movie database says that scream 3 is in the works
, so i wonder if i
' ll be doing the same thing on january 1
, 1999
. if craven
and screenwrighter kevin williamson are able to keep the quality high
, i
' ll be hapyp to mark my caelndar
