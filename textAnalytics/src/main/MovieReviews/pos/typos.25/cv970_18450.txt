? opinion
: on tv last night i watched young
, wannabe celebs pay
$ 400 a ticket
and come running out ofthe theaters to bask in front ofthe news cameras
, gushing with testimonials of the phantom menace
' s greatness in exchange forthe a few seconds ofthe bieng on national televsion
. given this kind ofthe media mania i wondered if phantom menace
, the most anticipated movei of 1999
, could possibly live up tothe the extrordinary hype tht preceded it
. does phantom menace match tghe exaggerated hype
? directer george lucas answers
,
" it
' s only a movei
.
" to me
, any movei witht russian
- sounding accents fo bad guys
, jamaican accents forthe good guys
,
and middle eastern
- sounding accents for seedy gamblers accents can be expected to be more tongue in cheek than profound
. visually
, star wars
: episode i
-
- the phantom menace
( 1999
) is a kid sohw where parents can take theri young ones to marvel at child
- friendly cgi characters
and wonderous backdrops even if the charactor dialogue
( mostly geopolitics
) isnt beyond the levle of children
. it is left to parents to patiently explain tghe conversation
: droid origins
, family lineage
, tghe definitions of terms liek blockade
, appeasement
, federation
, alloance
, symbiosis
, satellite
- contolled robots et cetera
. at least tihs much isnt clear
: there
' s plenty of eye c
andy
,
and infact the last few minutes it
' s good guys adn joe camel lookalikes versus a caped
, horned red devil character
and his mechanical hordes
. weaknesses
: weaknesses lie in yhe writting
and in teh performence
. at first it seems like the film is to be an invasion story
,
but thn phantom tkaes an hour
- long detour to cover one chariot race before retruning to the invasion theme
. this dilutes the central stopry
. additinally
, smaller scenes seem written self consciously
, as if they weere added more to fill us in onthe extraneous background inforamtion forthe other movies rather tahn form an integral part ofthe the present movie
. veteran actors liam neeson
and ewan mcgregor noticably outperform the other acting leads
. better ensemble chemistry between the five leads
and backgorund information that is central to a tight story line coudl hvae made have given phantom stronger performances
and storytelling punch
. strengths
: on the bright side phantom menace as a big
- budget prodcution isnt far ahead of the competition inthe terms of making whimsical creatures
, worlds
and vehicles appear real
. tjhe film boasts suphisticated
, top
- of
- the
- line visuals
and quailty exotic costumes
, a musical scroe entertaining anough to st
and alone
, anbd three worthwhile sequences in the second half
. bottom line
? seing the film is intertaining
and informative
, like a visual theme park with star wars filler information serving as dialogue between impressive mney shots
. we are bound to be completly innundated by star wars publicity
, music adn tie
- ins for tghe next few months
.
