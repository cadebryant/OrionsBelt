? opinion
: on tv last night i watched young
, wannabe celebs pay
$ 400 a ticket
and come running out ofthe theaters tothe bask in front of news cameras
, gushing with testimonials of the phantom menace ' s greatness iin exchange fo a few seconds of bieng onthe national television
. given this kind of media mania i wondered if phantom menace
, the most anticipated movie of 1999
, coudl possibly live up tothe thge extraordinary hype that preceeded it
. doesnt phantom menace match yhe exaggerated hype
? directer george lucas answers
,
" it ' s only a movie
.
" to me
, any movei with russian
- sounding accents for bad guys
, jamaican accents for good guys
,
and middle eastern
- sounding accents for seedy gamblers accents can be expected tothe be more tongue in cheek than profound
. visually
, star wars
: episode i
-
- the phantom menace
( 1999
) is a kid show where parents can take thier young ones tothe marvel at child
- freindly cgi characters
anbd wonderous backdrops even if the character dialogue
( mostly geopolitics
) is beyond the levle of childern
. it is left to parents to patiently explane the conversation
: droid origins
, family lineage
, the definitions of terms liek blockade
, appeasement
, federation
, alliance
, symbiosis
, satelite
- controlled robots et cetera
. at least this much is clear
: htere ' s plenty ofthe eye candy
,
adn inthe the last few mintues it ' s good guys
and joe camel lookalikes versus a caped
, horned red devil character
and his mecanical hordes
. weaknesses
: weaknesses lie in the wirting
and in the performance
. at first it seems like tghe film isnt to be an invasion story
,
bu
then phantom takes an hour
- long detour to cover one chariot race before returning to the invasion theme
. this dilutes the central sotry
. additionally
, smaller scenes seem writed self consciously
, as if tehy were added more to fill us in on extraneous background information for otehr movies rather than form an integral part of the present movie
. veteran actors liam neeson
anbd ewan mcgregor noticeably outperform the otehr acting leads
. better ensemble chemistry between the five leads
and background information tyhat is central to a tight story line could have made hvae given phantom stronger performances
and storytelling punch
. strengths
: onthe the bright side phantom menace as a big
- budget prodcution is far ahead ofthe yhe competition inspite terms of making whimsical creatures
, worlds
and vehicles appear real
. the film boasts sophisticated
, top
- of
- the
- line visuals
annd quality exotic costumes
, a musical score entertaining enough to stand alone
,
annd threee worthwhile sequences in thge second half
. bottom line
? seeing the film is intertaining
anbd informative
, liuke a visual theme park wiht star wars filler information serving as dialogue between impressive money shots
. we are bound to be completly inundated by star wars publicity
, music
and tie
- ins for the next few months
