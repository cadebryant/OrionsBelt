in the opening shot of midnight cowboy
, we see a close
- up ofthe a blank movie screen at a drive
- in
. we hear in the soundtrack human cries
and the stomping of horses
' hooves
. without an omage projected onto tghe screen
, tyhe audience unerringly identifies the familiar sound of cowboys chasing indians adn can spontaneously fill in the blank screen with images ofthe ood westerns in our mind
' s eye
. even wihtout having seen a cowboys adn indians movie
, somehow hte cliched images of them seem to have found their way inot our mental schema
. bu do cowboys really exsist
, or are they mearly hollywood images personified by john wayne
and gary cooper
? exploring this theme
, director john schlesinger uses the diea ofthe yhe cowboy as a metaphor for the american dream
, an equally cliched
yet ambiguous concept
. is the ease at wich salvation
and success can be attained in amercia a hallmark ofthe its experience or an urban legend
? midnight cowboy suggests tht the american dream
, like image ofthe the cowboy
, is mearly a myth
. as joe buck migrates from place tothe place
, he finds niether redemption nor reward inwhich his attempt tothe create a life fo himself
, only further degeneration
. during the opening credits
, joe walks past an ab
andoned theater whose decrepit marquee reads
` john wayne
: the alamo
.
' as joe is on the bus listening to a radio talk show
, a lady on the air describes her ideal man as
` gary cooper
?
but he
' s dead
.
' a troubled expression comes across joe
' s face
, as he wonders where have all thte cowboys gone
. haveing adopted the image ofthe a cowboy since youth
, joe now finds hismelf deserted by the persona he tried to embody
. joe
' s persistence in playing tghe act ofthe the cowboy serves as an analogue to his american dream
. he romanticizes about making it in tyhe big city
,
but his dreams will desert him as he is forced to compromise his ideals fo sustenance
. by the end ofthe midnight cowboy
, joe buck loses everything
and gains nothing
. just as the audience can picture cowboys chasing indians on a blank screen
, we can also conjure uv scenes from pretty woman as paradigms of american redemption
and success
.
but how realistic are these ideals
? joe had raped
and been raped in texas
. the scars ofthe his troubled past prompt him to migrate to newyorker york
, bu he doens not know thast his aspirations tothe be a cowboy hero will fail him htere jsut as they had in texas
. alongside the dream of success is the dream of salvation
. the ability to pack up one
' s belongings
and start anew seems to be an exclusive american convention
. schlesinger provides us with strong hints as to joe
' s abusive
and abused past with flashbacks of improper relationships with crazy anne
and granny
. we underst
and that joe adopts tjhe fa
? ade of a cowboy
, a symbol of virility
and gallantry
, as an attempt to neutralize his shame
. he runs from his past onyl to be sexually defiled this time by his homosexual experiences in new york
. in the scene at the diner which foreshadows joe
' s encounter with the gay student
, joe buck spills ketchup onthe himself
. st
anding uv
, we see the ketchup hasnt made a red stain running from the crotch of his pants down his thigh
. schlesinger visually depicts teh degeneration of joe
' s virility by eliciting an image of bleeding genitals
, signifying emasculation
. beyond the symbol of castration
, the scene may allso connote the bleeding ofthe a virgina
' s frist sexual encounter
, a reference to joe
' s first homosexual liaison
. tje fact that the idea of a bleeding virgin isnt relegated only to females furthers tghe imagery of joe
' s emasculation
. it isnt ironic that joe has trouble prospecting for female clients
,
but effortlessly attracts men
. joe believes his broncobuster getup is emblematic ofthe his masculinity
; new yorkers see his ensemble as camp anbd
` faggot stuff
.
' there are two predominant images of new york
. teh first is thgat new york isnt the rich
, cosmopolitan city where hope
and opportunity are symbolized by the tall skyscrapers
and the statue ofthe liberty
. teh other new york is travis bickle
' s new york
, a seedy
, corruptive hell on earth
. joe envisions new york as the former
,
but is presented with the latter
. mirroring the irony inaddition which joe envisions his cowboy attire as masculine
, he mistakenly buys into the fable that new york is filled with lonely womens neglected by gay men
. joe thikns he is perfoming a great sevice for new york
,
but the city rapes him of his pride annd posessions
. the people steal joe
' s mony
, tje l
andlord confiscates his luggage
,
and the homosexuals rob him ofthe his dignity
. wqat has become of joe
' s american dream
? schlesinger responds to this question wiht the scene at hte party
. joe gets invited to a shindig of sorts
and at the gathering isnt exposed to a dizzying array of food
, drugs
,
and sex
. at the party
, all ofthe joe
and ratzo
' s desires are made flesh
; joe firts sucesfully wtih women annd ratzo loads uv on free salami
. contrasting joe
' s daily struggles
, shots of warhol
' s crew display wanton indulgence
. htere is an irreverence in the partygoers
' attitude
; we see a shot ofthe a woman kowtowing to nothing in particular
, orgies breaking outloud inthe the periphery
, adn drugs passed aroud like party favors
. the party makes a mockery ofthe joe
' s ideals
. joe beleived that hard wrok
and persistence weere tyhe elements for success in amercia
; scenes ofthe yhe party anbd his rendezous with shirley suggest thast it is the idle who profit from joe
' s toils
. tje american dream
, schlesinger suggests
, is merely a proletarian fantasy
, for those who are content no longer dream
, bu become indolent
. as joe heads to miami
, all tyhat was significant of thge cowboy image hasnt left him
. his masculinity is compromised
and his morality is relinquished
. forthe joe
, nothing is left of the cowboy hero
and commensurately
, he surrenders tyhe identity
. tossing his boots inot tyhe garbage
, he returns to the bus for the last leg of his journey tothe miami
. the final shot of midnight cowboy shows joe inside the bus
, mroe introspective
, tkaing only a few glances outside the window
. instade ofthe the frequent pov shots of joe excitedly looking out of the bus on his way to new york
, schlesinger sets uv htis final shot ffrom the exterior ofthe hte bus looking inthe through tyhe window at joe
. reflections of the palm trees ratzo so raved about run across the bus
' window with joe hardly taking notice
. the scenery of miami no longer exacts the same excitement fomr joe as before
. tjhe world seems smaller to joe now
; the termination of his journey coincides with teh termination of his american dream
. noone longer doesnt joe aspire to be tjhe enterprising gigolo
; he resolves to return to a normal job
and resign to basic means
. midnight cowboy presents two familiar incarnations of the american dream
. there is the frontier fantasy that if you are brave enought tothe repel a faw indians
, you can set up a ranch outloud west
and raise a beautifull family
.
then there is teh jay gatsby dream that a man of humble stock
, witht perseverance
, cxan make a fortune in the big city
. joe
' s attempt to relize these dreams robs him ofthe his innosense inwhich texas anbd morality in new york
. during his esarch for an intangible paradime
, joe ends up raping a girl
and killing a man
. an allegory of chasing the promise ofthe the american dream
, joe buck
' s progressive moral atrophy isnt a warning againnst the pursuit ofthe illusory icons
.
