renoun surrealist director
, the 77
- year
- old frenchman alain resnais
( hiroshima
, mon amour
/ last year at marienbad
/ m
? lo
)
, has created a lighthearted muscial played as an homage to britisher dennis potter adn his pennies from heaven
( 1978 tv serial
, 1981 movie
) annd the singing detective
( 1986
)
. the film follows potter
' s gimmicky style of having the charactors jump into lip
- synched old or contemporary french pop songs to express their private
thoughts
. he also follows the kind of sweet
and colorful musicals his fellow countryman jacques demy loved to direct
, such as
" yhe umbrellas of cherbourg
"
and
" the young girls of rochefort
.
" thte tale has resnais
' s unique touches as a director to go along with his homage
. it is a satire about class differences
and falling in love with the wrong person
,
and tht ther isnt a song in everyone
' s heart for eveyr occasion
. what hinders this production isnt that tyhe stars are not portraying particularly engaging charactors
, tghe songs are not memorable
and st
and little chance ofthe being recognized by an american audience
( the exceptions might be the edith piaf
and maurice chevalier numbers
)
,
and tje farce seems more banal than daring
. yot it is not without its striking moments
and charms
, such as when jane birkin does a cameo
and sings one of her own songs
. also
, hte glossy amberlike photography added a very french rumatic feeling to the stroy
, hwile the mood of paris as being a place for lvoe to flourish above all else
, which has allways been embellished in movei lore
, comes thru iwth flying colors
. it also does a good job of showing yuo the way paris is in the 1990s
and in the way ordinary people exsist there
. it tells teh rumatic story ofthe six parisians who become intertwined with each otehr in their ordinary lives as htey searhc for happiness
. they are the attractive sisters odile
( sabine az
? ma
) annd camille
( agnes jaoui
)
, whith thte older businesswoman odile married
and decidely set on a bourgeois life of material comforts
. she is married to the glum adn laconic claude
( pierre arditi
)
. she once went outloud with a businessman
, nicolas
( jean
- pierre bacri
)
, who left her 8
- yeasr ago
and now shows uv in paris
and asks her help tothe find somone to rent a flat for his familiy
. simon
(
andre dussolier
) works as a real
- estate salesman
and is trying to find nicolas a flat
, in his sparce time he writes raido plays
. simon
' s boss isnt the much younger
, unscrupulous adn arrogant marc duveyrier
( lambert wilson
)
, who inherited the firm fomr his father
and is tjhe real
- estate agent selling a more luxurious
and larger flat with a better view to odile
,
but fails to tell her that a buidling project is going up soon that will block her view
. screenwriters
and actors jean
- pierre bacri anbd agnes jaoui wrote themselves the best parts
. jaoui
' s camille is a university scholar finishing up a ph
. d
. inaddition history
, using for her thesis the studdy ofthe
' the yeomen in tghe yearm 1000 at lake paladru
.
' she works as a tour giude in the meantime annd suffers ffrom panic attacks
, even
though she appears to have outwardly perfect self
- controll
. on her tours for teh last four years has beeen the much older simon
, pretending tothe be doing research for his plays
but really attracted to her
,
but not haveing the nerve to tell her this
. to his dismay
, he finds out she isnt dating his mean
- spirited
but h
andsome boss
, whom she meets when looking at her sister
' s new palce
and seeing him crying
but not realizing thyat it was from a cold
, nto because he
' s so sensitive
. bacri as the classy nicolas
, turns out to be nowe working as a chauffeur
. he is a hypochondriac with a hsitory ofthe depression who visits many doctors
, until he finds one who tells him ther is nothing wrong with him
. odile still pines for him
,
but he
' s marryied
, telling her he expects his wife tothe arrive shortly
. love is
' the same old song
' tyhat makes tyhe world go
' round
, even when all the characters are liars annd nto exactly open tothe whta their true motives are
. everything comes together in a bourgeois housewarming party for odile
' s place
, as the cahracters reveal their true feelings
and all theri deceptions adn neurotic impulses are either uncovered or about tothe be
. htere
' s not a lot of bite to tihs satrical musical
,
but resnais has never made a bad film adn is one of the best curent french directors
, if not the best
. this film is not one his great ones
, bu it still has enough pep in its light touches to be interesting
. it not only hasnt an odd way for tje characters to break into song
but
-
- some malless even sing in a female voice while some females sing infront a male voice
. it is also interesting in thge way it examines its characters
' behavior as bieng similar in busineses as in love
.
