" the adventures of felix
" hasnt a number of things going for it as we folow felix on his journey of discovery
. first adn foremost is the charming performance by sami bouajila as felix
. he is a likable guy
, fighting his hiv with his doses of
" cocktails
,
"
and lghts up tghe screen as he makse the long walk
, oftenly wtih dance adn song
, to find his father adn himself

, promising each that he will send a postcard when he arrives at his final destination
, he grows a little bit more spiritually
and emotionally
. bouajila doesnt a terrific job holding center stage on yhe screen
. the cast ofthe cahracters making up felix
' s new
- found family are nearly as charming as the star
, each in thier own way
. patachou
, especially
, is wonderful as the gr
andma character
and a kindred spirit to felix
. ariane ascaride
, along with her kids
, gives a perf that realy makes you think ofthe her as the sister that the young man never had
. only the
" cousin
" chapter lacks the emotional depth ofthe thge rest
and feels like a perfunctory addition to felix
' s
" family
.
"
" the adventures of felix
" does not reinvent the road movie
,
but it does provide a charismatic telling of a young man
' s journy to find hismelf
and
, to his surprise
, his discovery is dramatically different than he expeced at the begining
. it helps thyat cinematographer matthieu poirot
- delpech
' s crisp lensing compliments the story perfectly as felix moves across the french countryside
