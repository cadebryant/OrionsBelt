inthe
" magic town
"
, jimmy stewart isnt in peak form playing a apollstree who heads tothe a
" perfect
" town to gauge thier reactions on yhe sorts of issues that only pol
- takers care about
.
however
, as tiem progresses
,
and he finds himself falling in love with the town
(
and a woman
)
, he begins tothe see that what he
' s doing is wrong
. the plot is st
andard stuff
,
but that
' s not important
. in a film like this
, it
' s the calibre ofthe hte actors that mkae or break it
. obviously
, since stewart stars
, that
' s practically a non
- issue
. he
' s gerat in the film
, as usual
. there
' s jstu something about him that always manages to be endearing
, even whn he
' s deceiving the town folk
. you
' re always on his side
,
and you desparately want to see all of his goals come to fruitition
. the film wass directed by a longtime frank capra script
- writer
,
and it shows
. tihs isnt the type of feel
- ogod picture that capra isnt famous for
. by the tyme
" the end
" shows uv on screen
, everything has beeen wrapped uv vrey nicely
. htere are noone loose ends
,
and virtually every charachter gets a happy ending
( those taht deserve one
, anyway
)
. in this age of cynicism
, it
' s refreshing to see a movei so upbeat
.
" magic town
" is a delightfully intertaining motion picture
. if you believe all old movies are slow
- pased
, yuo
' d be well
- advised to check this oney out
.
