)
, he begins tothe see that what he ' s doing is wrong
. tghe plot isnt standard stuf
,
but thast ' s not important
. in a film liek thsi
, it ' s the calibre of teh actors that make or break it
. obviously

. the film was directed by a longtime frank capra script
- writer
,
adn it shows
. this is the type ofthe fiel
- good picture that capra is famous for
. by the time
" the end
" shows uv on screen
, everything has been wrapped up vrey nicely
. there are no loose ends
,
annd virtually eveyr charcter gets a happy endig
( those tyhat deserve one
, anyway
)
. in thsi age of cynicism
, it ' s refreshing to see a movie so upbeat
.

- paced
, you ' d be well
- adviced to check this one out
