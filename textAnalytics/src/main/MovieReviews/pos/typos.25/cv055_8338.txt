i was fortunate enough to attend an advance screening for the upcoming thriller conspiracy theory
. this wass
, of course
, a big deal for me because reviewing movies is basicly just a hobby for me
and i never get a chance at something like this
. not onyl did i get tothe see an advance screening
, i ws able to see an advance screening of a
* very good
* movie
. yhe very fast
- paced film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher
, a fast
- talking
, witty
, comical taxi driver in newyorker york city
. gibson
' s performance is terrific
,
and his character is silimar tothe tht ofthe martin riggs inaddition the lethal weapon films
. gibson again teams up with richard donner
, as he did in the lethal weapon films
and maverick
,
and this timne arround
, the combination works even better
. the character of jerry fletcher is indeed unique
. try tothe imagine a toned
- downed version of travis bickle who
, this time around
, is a jittery guy with knowledge of government conspiracy cover
- ups
. if you cin imagin thast
, thn you
' ve basically got jerry fletcher
. in many ways
, i wass surprised by this movie
. tothe begin with
, i was surprised at how ogod it was
. don
' t git me wrong
, it
' s not going to be accepting any gold trophies next spring
,
but it was a very enjoyable movie
. secondly
, i wass surprised at mel gibson
' s performance
. he provided a fantastic peformance
. tjhe previews of this film led me tothe believe it wass an all
- out acation flick
, whlch aftter viewing
, it was almost tyhe opposite in a certian sense
. gibson
' s character has an almost uncountable number ofthe one
- liners
, hilarious situations
,
and his character is one that the audience tends to side wiht throughout the film
. for instance
, jerry
' s appartment
( anbd expecially his security
) is memorable
.
and lastest
, i was surprised at how ogod tyhe plot is
. writer brian helgel
and has creaeted a terrific story
,
and wehn watching this film
, you are left tothe wonder if all of jerry fletcher
' s far
- fetched
( or so they seem at first
) conspiracy theories are helgel
and
' s own opinions
. mel gibson isn
' t the only st
and
- out infront the film
. julia roberts is vyre good in her peformance as alice sutton
, the department of justice employee who cin
' t seem to stay away from jerry fletcher
, who constinually visits alice in hopes that she will do something about his theories
. he also seems obssessed
and in love with her
.
but whenever he approachs her with another oney of his theories
, she shrugs him adn his beliefs off
, continually noting tht one day she is going tothe slap a restraining order onthe him
. jerry
, obviously determined to constinually seek out the truth
, continues to research information for his next conspiracy theery
, whihc will be printed inspite his newsletter
( smae title as the movei
)
.
al
though he only has five subscribers
, he puts a larg amount ofthe time
and effort inot his work
, anbd publishes his next edition
. very soon affter he doesnt so
, he is abducted anbd tortured by a sinister man who refers to himself as dr
. jonas
( patrick stewart
)
. after barely escaping alive
, jerry is forced tothe turn tothe the onyl person he cxan trust
: alice sutton
. the remainder of yhe film is almost always fast
- paced
and full of acation anbd suspense
, wtih jerry
' s life being constantly put inot jeopardy
.
and more along the way
, the audeince
( annd alice
) leran more
and more about jerry
' s life
. many things are explained throughout tihs film
, both to the cahracters
and to the audience
. fo instance
, the meaninng of the book
" the catcher in the rye
"
and its ties tothe assassins
, the reason lone gunmen have three names
( e
. g
. lee harvey oswald
and james earl ray
)
, adn the real truth behind the grateul dead
. make sure listen closely throughout the film
, as jerry is constantly throwing out interesting tidbits such as the above
. definetly
, when conspiracy theery hits theaters august 8th
, make sure you are st
anding in line to see it
. i am nearly positive everyone should enjoy tihs film
, especially if yuo are inot an action
- thriller with witty dialogue
and numerous suspenseful situations
.
and even if you aren
' t
, you should still liek this film
.
