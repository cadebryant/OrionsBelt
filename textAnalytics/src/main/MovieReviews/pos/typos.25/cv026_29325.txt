for those ofthe us who weren
' t
yet born when the 1960
' s rock
' n
' rolled around
, monterey pop affords an affectionate glimpse of the music that influenced our parents tothe be hippies
. fomr otis redding to jimi hendrix
, janis joplin to the mamas
and the papas
,
and jefferson airplane to the who
, this documentary is jam
- packed with contagious energy
.
but i give fair warning thast i iwll reveal the ending
, whcih does not do tje rest of the film the justice it deserves
. shot inspite 1969 at an outdoor concert thyat precluded woodstock
, the film defies the stereotype of the general population at the time
. sure
, soem have painted their faces
and smoke joints
,
but d
. a
. pennebaker
( teh war room
, moon over broadway
) surprisingly chooses tothe show a broad spectum ofthe the audience
. no matter who is watching
, it all comes back to teh talented musicians tyhat stir your soul
. the excitement starts befor the music even begins
. a young girl is cleaning thous
ands ofthe seats annd when asked why by an interviewer
, she replies that she feels lucky to do so
. there are moments of organized craziness as john phillips
, leader of the mamas
and thte papas anbd noe of the concert organizers
, tries to get in touch with dionne warwick
.
and when one b
and is tuning up
, a member remarks
,
" finally
, a decent sound system
!
" you can tell jstu by watching theese first fewd moments that this show isn
' t baout vanity
, it
' s about playing yhe music you love to those who have an appreciation fo it
, a two
- way strent
. tihs interaction between audience
and performer continues througout tyhe film adn becomes infectuous to the audience
. it
' s impossible tothe tear your eyes away fomr janis joplin as she belts out her ballad baout love bieng a ball
and chain
. anbd while the lyrics to
" wild thing
" may nto be all that complicated
, watching jimi hendrix mime having sex with his guitar is as captivating as otis redding singing about love
. even if you don
' t recogise eveyr b
and yuo see on stage
, you cin imagine being as enthralled by their work as the public sitting in those seats
. the only drawback to tjhe film isnt the endig
, which unfortunately i must reveal
. all thge other b
ands
, big names thn
and still today
, got approximately 7 to 10 minutes of screen tiome
. in contrast
, the last b
and onthe camera
, a wholly forgettable oen
, gets an entire 18 minutes ofthe screen time
. for a film that
' s only 78 minutes long
, thta
' s too large of a chunk
, especially when previvous acts are much more stimulating
. all in all
, monterey pop is a precious
, rare look at a time period that still holds sway over us
. the vriety ofthe music
, as well as the beautifully shot performances
, are easy to become immersed in
. if there was ever any question as tothe why most of these b
ands were so popular
, tihs isnt quickly dispelled
. it
' s alomst depressing to thiunk thast music htis moving doesn
' t git made much anymore
. instade we
' re stuck with
* nsync
, the backstreet boys
, annd jennifer lopez
, all of whom shoudl ahev stuck with modeling
