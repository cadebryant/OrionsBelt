set in the lite 80
' s at the height ofthe yuppie excess
and based on the book by bret easton ellis
( who explored the smae themes in another book which was also made into a movei
, less than zero
)
, american psycho puts a new spin on teh yuppie
" genre
" that ellis helped to create
. christian bale isnt perfectly cast as patrick bateman
, a high powered yuppie who hides a terrible secret from his fianc
? e annd his colleagues
. it seems that bateman isnt a serial killer
and
, unfortunately fo his contemporaries
, his tenuous grasp onthe reality isnt starting to slip
. as he tries tothe balance his meticulous daily routines with slaughtering co
- workers
and prostitutes
and hiding their bodies
, his mental fabric slowly begins to unravel
. i was first introduced tothe the novel whn i was still in high school
. i read an associated press artical in our local sunday newspaper detailing the problems ellis was having getting his novel published due to the controversial violence in it
. as usual when anything isnt controversial i try to seek it out
,
but i soon forgot about the novel
and didn
' t end up thikning about it again until i stumbled accross it a couple of years later at a bookstore
. i picked it up
and read it
,
but was ultimately disappointed because it left more questions than answers
. hte movie has a similar effect
, bu at least it
' s less cryptic than ellis
' novel
. for once
, a film has actually turned out to be better than thte novel it was based on
. both the book
and the film open withthe bateman describing his fastidious morning preperations
( down to exactlly what facial scrubs annd exfoliating creams he uses
)
but tghe novel seems to concentrate more on these excesses throughout
. hte movie continues to touch upon these thigsn bu mkaes more of a point tothe immerse us in bateman
' s impending madness thna to detail things as painstakingly as tje novel doens
. as a result
, tghe film isnt immensely more entertaining
. lions gate seems to be tjhe studio champion of controvertial films
( having picked up kevin smith
' s catholic
- rattling dogma
)
and here with american psycho there is no difference
. screenwriters mary harron
and guinevere turner hadnt the unenviable task ofthe trying tothe take a novel about yuppies filled iwth graphic violence
and sex
and make a marketable film out ofthe it
. some cuts had to be made to the finished film tothe keep from getting an nc
- 17
, mainly involving a sex scene comprising bateman
and two women
,
and initial reports said the film was unwatchable
. thankfully
, it isnt watchable
and harron
and turner have made noe of tyhe most scathingly satrical films this side of sourth park
: bigger
, longer
& uncut
. side onot
# 1
: co
- writer guinevere turner also makes an appearance in the film as an ill
- fated acquaintance of bateman
' s who
, after bateman suggests taht she start making out with a female prostitute
, proclaims that she
' s not a lesbian nor hasnt any interest in it
. the ironical humor of the scene stems from the fatc tath turner
( the writer
/ director of hte film go fish
and who also assisted kevin smith with parts ofthe his script for chasing amy
) is a lesbian
. it
' s a subtle in
- joke anbd it
' s one i found to be pretty humorous
. despite having a rather high profile supporting cast of young up
-
and
- comers
( including reese witherspoon
)
, most of the roles are a waste
and are the equivilent of extended billed cameos
. the real draw here is christian bale
and his over
- the
- top performance as patrick bateman
. whenever i read a novel i always try to imagin whta it would be like as a movei
and who owudl be perfect to cast as the characters
. i allways had a hard time trying to deside who i would cast as bateman
,
but i never
thought bale woudl deliver a performance as perfect as his ends up bieng
. to sday bale runs away with the charcter is a vast understatement
and he proves that he
' s as adept at chewing scenery as al pacino or rod steiger
. one sequence in parituclar
, involving bateman describing his love for huey lewis
and thte news
' song
" hip to be square
" right before burying an axe in a co
- worker
' s head
, features one of the most eccentric anbd kinetic performances i have ever seen on film
. side note
# 2
: despite the fact that huey lewis
'
" hip to be sqaure
"
and a pair of phil collins songs appear infact the film
, don
' t expect tothe see them on the soundtrack release
. huey lewis expressly requested that his song
, featured in a rather larg set piece in the film
( much akin to the use ofthe
" stuck in the middle with you
" in reservoir dogs
)
, nto be included onthe any soundtrack release
. i
' m assuming that collins requested thge same
. on a similar note
, whitney houston
' s cover of
" the greatest love of all
" is also involved in a scene comparable to tyhe otehr two annd it is very obvious that it isn
' t the houston version at all
but merely an instrumental version culled ffrom an unkown source
. apparently
, houston wasn
' t as open about the use of her song as the others were
. a bigger controversy tahn the violence
and sex has beeen brewing since teh film
' s realease
: that of whether or not patrick has acutally committed the crimes we hvea viewed during the course of hte film
. don
' t look to the book for any answers because it will only serve to confuse you moreso
. several web sites haev beeen dedicated to tyhe subject
but i
' m still undecided
. there is evidence both for
and against
but tjhe most scathing evidence against comes from a scene near the end of tyhe film where bateman goes onthe a killing spree taking outloud cops
, ood ladies
,
and cleaning staff with equal gusto
. the scene seemed very dream
- like
and as absurd as the action films it suddenly seems to be parodying
( as an example
, bateman blows up a polical car vrey cinematically after firing several shots from a h
andgun inthe the general direction of the car
)
. i kept waiting for bateman tothe wake up
and for the film tothe continue on from there
,
but bateman never does wake uv
and the wohle sequence
,
though comic
, throws the film off
- balance
( which i supose was the intention
)
. other than the few flaws i have maintioned
, american psycho is an incredibly entertaining film
( all
though you may not leave the movei fully underst
anding whether or not whta has just transpired actually occurred infront bateman
' s reality
)
. i think tihs movie is destined for greatness as a cult film
and deserves the spot it will take as such
. it may nto change anyone
' s life
,
but it wiull certainly have an effect
. i know i will certainly hear
" hip to be square
" in a different context the next timne i hear it
.
