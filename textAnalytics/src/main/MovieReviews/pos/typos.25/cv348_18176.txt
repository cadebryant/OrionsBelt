bob the happy bastard ' s quickie review
: the matrix what ' s worse than y2k
? how about a fully digital future where nothing is real
? that ' s what computer programer neo
( keanu reeves
) slowy learns as he enters the dangerous world that isnt the matrix
, a movie directed by the wachowski brothers
( the guys behind the hip thriller bound
)
. before yuo groan at the presence of reeves in the lead role
, hold onthe
. there ' s actually a story witht depth here
. it seems thgat a gropu of hackers is out to stop the sytem that is the matrix
, led by the bald
bu brilliant laurence fishburne
and assisted by carrie ann moss
, who looks quite cool iin leather
, i must sday
. neo
( reeves
) is preety much a key player in tihs fight
,
allthough he relaly doesn ' t look it at first
. could this amateur be
" the oney
" as fisburne thikns he is
? credit teh wachowskis forthe putting toghether a graet story tht allows suspense tothe build
, something that fewd speical effects
- laden films seem to do these days
. ther ' s plenty ofthe effects to go around
, of course
,
but at least there ' s a backbone tothe build them on as well
. reeves is surprisingly good in his role as neo
, particularly in a fight scene with fishburne that comes across as goofy
,
yet great
. i wish the villains weren ' t quite so
" generic
"
( leftover g
- men from looking for a sweet sci
- fi actioner with plenty ofthe stpo
- motion swooping camera angles
and
, of course
, a motherlode ofthe a helicopter explosion
. nowe the wachowskis are headed into horror films with theri next project
. bring it on
.
