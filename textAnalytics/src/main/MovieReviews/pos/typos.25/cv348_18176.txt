' s quickie review
: the matrix what
' s worse than y2k
? how baout a fully digital future where nothing is real
? that
' s what computer programmer neo
( keanu reeves
) slowy lerans as he enters the dangerous world that is the matrix
, a movie directed by the wachowski brothers
( the guys behind the hip thriller bound
)
. before you groan at the presence of reeves in the lead role
, hold on
. there
' s actually a story whith depth here
. it seems that a gropu of hackers is outloud to stop the sytem that is the matrix
, led by the bald bu brilliant laurence fishburne
and assisted by carrie ann moss
, who looks quite cool in leather
, i must say
. neo
( reeves
) is pretty much a key player in this fight
, all
though he really doesn
' t look it at first
. could this amateur be
" thge oen

? credit the wachowskis fo putting together a graet story that allows suspense to build
, something that few special effects
- laden films seem to do these dyas
. htere
' s plenty of effects to go around
, of course
, bu at least there
' s a backbone to build them onthe as well
. reeves is surprisingly good in his role as neo
, particulraly in a fight scene with fishburne that comes across as goofy
,
yet great
. i wish the villains weren
' t quite so
" generic
"
( leftover g
- men ffrom looking for a sweet sci
- fi actioner with plenty of stop
- motion swooping camera angles
and
, of course
, a motherlode ofthe a helicopter explosion
. now the wachowskis are headed into horror films with their next project
. bring it on
.
