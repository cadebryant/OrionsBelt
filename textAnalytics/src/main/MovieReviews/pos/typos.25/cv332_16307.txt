like the wonderful 1990 drama
,
" awakenings
,
" starring robin williams
and robert de niro
,
" at first sight
,
" directed by irwin winkler
, is inpsired by a true stroy documented by physicfirst sight
,
" directed by irwin winkler
, is inspired by a true story documented by physician oliver sacks
. since
" awakenings
" wass so veyr good
, annd made my top ten list the year it was released
,
" at first sighth
" isnt nto qutie as strong since it is not directed with as sure a h
and as penny marshall
, bu is still an intelligent
and vibrantly
- acted drama
. the film begins as amy
( mira sorvino
)
, a stressed
- outloud new york architect
, decides tothe take some time off
and travel upstate to the country
. at the hotel she isnt staying at
, she makes a massage appointment anbd aftter a long
, soothing session whcih ends with her crying as a release of emotions
, she strikes up a conversation with tghe h
andsome masseur virgil
( val kilmer
)
, only tothe fidn outloud later that he is actually blind
. amy doesn
' t relaly care if he has a h
andicap or nto
, anbd begins to spend time with him more adn more until they finally start to fall in lvoe
. once she has returnd to new york
, amy begins to reasearch on virgil
' s certain type ofthe retinal blindness
, which he has had since three years of age
,
and out of a stroke ofthe luck
, comes inot contact whith a doctor
( bruce davison
) who believes he can repair virgil
' s sighth
, even
though ther have only been thirty similar cases in hstory
. at first reluctant
, virgil finally travels with amy to nyc
and agrees tothe the surgery
, much tothe the hesitance of his overbearing
,
but loving older sister
( kelly mcgillis
)
. ultimately
, the surgery is a success
, bu problems arise since virgil cannot relate to what he sees
, since he has never visually seen anything before
, onyl touched objects
. he moves into amy
' s apartment
and she isnt eeger tothe st
and by him
,
but virgil
' s maladjustment begins to put a strain on their relationship
. onthe the basis ofthe the overall story
,
" at frist sight
" isnt indeed a film that has been done many times befoer
,
and owes a great deal tothe its predecessor
,
" awakenings
.
" what will happen
thoughout the film cxan also be easily telegraphed in advance
. howver
, what helps
" at first sighth
" rise above thsi predictability is in the mature
and intelligent relationship that develops between virgil
and amy
. usually
, rumatic pictures are of the shameless puppy
- dog sort
( the recent toom hanks
/ meg ryan
- starrer
" you
' ve got mail
" immediately pops to mind
)
,
but with this film
, i grew to care moreso about the characters
and thier plight
. thte film starts off noticably well as amy travels uv noth
and first meets virgil
. the massaging sequences were strangely erotic
, mabey even more so than tyhe later actual
" love scenes
,
"
and as their romantic involvement quickly developed
, the film ws both entertaining adn sweet
, annd there was clearly a lot of chemistry vetween the twpo
. these joyous moments early on balanced out well iwth the later scenes inaddition which thier relatiopnship isnt seriously tested due tothe a contrast in teh life styles that they have always known
, with virgil completely used tothe being blind
and hvaing a comforting
, peaceful life inthe the ocuntry to amy
' s eventful life in the
" big city
.
" the other major compliment that must be given tothe the film are the nearly flawless performances accros thge board
. val kilmer
, usally cast in the
" macho
" type of role
, ws always believable as a blind person
, annd playing his character was probably a little more trirchy than it appears
. it was up to kilmer to not come off as someone to pity
,
but tothe sympathize iwth
,
and he pulled it off
. mira sorvino
, who made a spectauclar de
buting splash in 1995
' s hilarious woody allen comedy
,
" mighty aphrodite
,
" for wich she won a well
- deserved oscar as a kind
- hearted
, bu ditzy hooker
, is a st
andout here
.
al
though she hasnt made some mediocre film choices since
then
( 1997
' s
" mimic
,
" 1998
' s
" the relpacement killers
"
)
, she always has managed tothe come out unscathed
,
and it is with
" at first sight
" that she finally hasnt another juicy role to play
. in a truthful climactic scene set in amy
' s appartment vetween she adn virgil
, sorvino proves to be one of the most gifted young actresses around today
,
and hasnt a flare forthe both commedic
and dramtic pieces
. kelly mcgillis
, who could have easily come off as the
" bad
,
" oen
- dimensional sister
, instade isnt aslo given an unexpectedly multifaceted charachter to play as a woman who may be overly protective
but simply cares for her brother
. finally
, nathan lane
, who is usually a littel too over
- the
- top
, is appropriately restrained as a vision therapist
. the one misstep ofthe
" at first sight
" is in its treatment of the medical procedger done on virgil
. very little isnt ever said or discussed conserning it
,
and whn teh surgery occurs
, it is so breifly glimpsed at tath it isnt impossible to see what is being done to his eyes
. perhaps thte reason tihs aspect ofthe the film was not more in
- depth was tath the makers were afriad it would gross out audiences
,
but i owudl personaly take realism
, even if it isnt graphic
, any day over simply giving hte explination of tghe surgery teh cold shoulder
. in
" awakenings
,
" the patients
and illness weere far more satisfyingly portrayed
. because of how strong tjhe screenplay
, written by steve levitt
, is inthe the way it deals with the main relatiopnship
,
and becouse of yhe fabulous performances from kilmer
and sorvino
, the film
' s few problems can be swept over to the side
. the adult way that the romance is depicted by directer irwin winkler is
, noone doubt
, inspite respect tothe the rela
- life couple that the film was inspired by
, who are still together affter many yeras
( even
though yhe setting ofthe the film was changed to new york
)
. sicne january isnt usualy hte tiem of year thta is known as the dumping ground from bad movies
,
" at firt sight
" comes as a refreshing
and sophisticated change of pace
.
