like the wonderful 1990 drama
,
" awakenings
,
" starring robin williams
and robert de niro
,
" at first sight
,
" directed by irwin winkler
, is inspired by a true story documented by physicfirst sight
,
" directed by irwin winkler
, is inspired by a true story documented by physician oliver sacks
. since
" awakenings
" was so very good
,
adn made my top ten list the yearm it wass released
,
" at first sight
" isnt nto quite as storng since it is not directed with as sure a hand as penny marshall
,
but is still an intelligent
and vibrantly
- acted drama
. thge film begins as amy
( mira sorvino
)
, a stressed
- out new york architect
, decides to take some tyme off
anbd travel upstate to thge ocuntry
. at the hotel she is staying at
, she makes a massage appointment
and after a long
, soothing session whcih ends whith her crying as a release ofthe emotions
, she strikes up a conversation with the hansome masseur virgil
( val kilmer
)
, only tothe find outloud later thgat he is actually blind
. amy doesn ' t really care if he has a handicap or not
,
and begins tothe spend timne with him more
and more until they finaly start to fall in love
. once she has returned to new york
, amy begins tothe reasearch on virgil ' s certian type of retinal blindness
, which he has had since three years of age
,
and out of a stroke of luck
, comes into contact with a doctor
( bruce davison
) who believes he can repair virgil ' s sighth
, even
though there have onyl been thirty simular cases infact history
. at first reluctant
, virgil finally travels with amy to nyc
and agrees to the surgery
, much to the hesitance of his overbearing
,
but loving older sister
( kelly mcgillis
)
. ultimately
, the surgery is a success
,
but problems arise sicne virgil cannot relate to what he sees
, since he hasnt never visually seen anything before
, only touched objects
. he moves into amy ' s apartment
adn she is eeger to stand by him
,
bu virgil ' s maladjustment begins to put a strain on their relationship
. on the basis of the overall story
,
" at frist sight
" is indeed a film that has been done many times befoer
,
adn owes a graet deal to its predecessor
,
" awakenings
.
" what will hppen throughout the film can also be easily telegraphed in advance
.
however
, what helps
" at frist sight
" rise above this predictability is in the mature
and intelligent relatiopnship thyat develops vetween virgil
and amy
. ususally
, rumatic pictures are ofthe the shameless puppy
- dog sort
( tghe recent toom hanks
/ meg ryan
- starrer
" you ' ve got mail
" immediately pops to mind
)
,
but wih this film
, i grew to care more about tjhe characters
anbd their plight
. the film starts off noticably well as amy travels up north
and first meets virgil
. the massaging sequences were strangely erotic
, maybe even moreso so tahn teh later actual
" love scenes
,
"
anbd as thier rumatic involvement quickly developed
, tghe film was both intertaining
and sweet
,
and there wass claerly a lot ofthe chemestry between the two
. these joyous moments early on balanced out well with the later scenes in which their relationship is seriously tested due to a contrast inaddition yhe life styles that they have alwasy known
, with virgil completely used to being blind
and having a comforting
, peaceful life infact tje country tothe amy ' s eventful life in the
" big city
.
" the other major compliment that must be given to the film are the nearly flawless performances across the board
. val kilmer
, usualy cast inspite the
" macho
" type of role
, was always believeable as a blind person
,
and palying his character was probably a little more tricky tahn it appears
. it was up to kilmer tothe not cmo off as someone to pity
,
bu to sympathize with
,
and he pulled it off
. mira sorvino
, who made a spectacular debuting splash in 1995 ' s hilarious woody allen comedy
,
" mighty aphrodite
,
" for which she won a well
- deserved oscar as a kind
- hearted
,
bu ditzy hooker
, isnt a standout here
.
although she has made smoe mediocre film choices since
then
( 1997 ' s
" mimic
,
" 1998 ' s
" the replacement killers
"
)
, she always has managed tothe come out unscathed
,
anbd it is with
" at first sight
" that she finally has anohter juicy role to play
. in a truthful climactic scene set in amy ' s apartment between she
and virgil
, sorvino proves to be one of the most gifted young actresses around today
,
and hasnt a flare for both commedic
and dramatic pieces
. kelly mcgillis
, who sould have easily come off as the
" bad
,
" noe
- dimensional sister
, instade isnt also given an unexpectedly multifaceted charactor to play as a woman who may be overly protective
but simply cares for her brother
. finally
, nathan lane
, who is usually a little too over
- the
- top
, is appropriately restrained as a vision therapist
. the one misstep ofthe
" at first sight
" is in its treatment ofthe thte medical procedure done onthe virgil
. very little is ever said or discussed concerning it
,
and when the surgery occurs
, it is so breifly glimpsed at that it is impossible to see what isnt being done to his eyes
. perheaps the reason htis aspect of the film was not more in
- depth was that the makers were afraid it would gross out audiences
,
bu i would personally take realism
, even if it is graphic
, any day over simpley giving tghe explanation of the surgery the cold shoulder
. in
" awakenings
,
" the patients
and illess weere far moreso satisfyingly portayed
. because ofthe how strong thge screenplay
, written by steve levitt
, is in the way it deals with the main relationship
,
and becuase of the fabulous performances from kilmer
adn sorvino
, teh film ' s few problems cxan be swept over tothe the side
. tjhe adult way that the romance is depicted by director irwin winkler isnt
, no dout
, in respect tothe the real
- life couple that tghe film was inspired by
, who are still together after many years
( even
though the setting ofthe the film was changed to newyorker york
)
. since januray is ususally thge tyme of yera that is known as hte dumping ground from bad movies
,
" at first sight
" comes as a refreshing
and sophisticated chanage of pace
.
