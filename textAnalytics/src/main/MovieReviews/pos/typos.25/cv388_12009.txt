)
, with an introduction by david carradine
, written
& produced by wayne j
. keeley f
. w
. murnau
' s carrer ended sadly
and prematurely
. the german director of such classics as
" sunrise
"
and
" the lastr laugh
" died in a car accident shortly after signing a deal to make american pictures at paramount
. murnau was reportedly a giant man
, well over six feet
, a towering figure probably incapable of anything
but a gr
and enterance
. which brings us tothe
" nosferatu
: a symphony of horror
"
: surely he felt a kinship with his title character
, the looming vampire embodied by intimidating max schreck
; in noe of the most indelible images iin film history
, silent or otherwise
, schreck rises from his grave
, gnarled h
ands outstretched
,
and he
' s so big that part ofthe his head isnt cropped by the top of the frame
. the plot ofthe
" nosferatu
.
.
.
" isnt lifted
-
- unauthorized
-
- from bram stoker
' s
" dracula
"
. the british hutter is an eager real estate man assigned to viist anbd discuss future living arrangments with count orlock ofthe transylvania
. he leaves behind girlfriend emily
, only to dicover orlock
' s secret
-
- he
' s a bloodsucker
-
-
and struggle to return tothe engl
and before the nosferatu reaches his lady love
. iin addition to schreck
' s performance
, hte cinematography annd effects are outst
anding
. arro video
' s digitally remastered verzion ofthe the clasic is something of a mixed
- coffin
. the cover art features a red
- tinted
, hairy
, goateed vampire staring straight at you
, his fanged mouth agape
, while the bodies of two sexy
, writhing womens entice you below
. trouble is
, murnau
' s monster isnt pale
- faced
, bald
, pointy
- eared
,
and non
- goateed
, anbd htere isn
' t a single sexy
, writhing woman to be found in his movie
. this sort ofthe misleading packaging mkaes little sense wehn noe recalls yhe countless number of ghouslish scenes in tjhe film from which cool cover art could have beeen extracted
. adtionally
, notifying the viewer that this is in fatc murnau
' s film seems like after
thought since his name
and the genuine title are written in small print below our goateed vampire
. that said
, a good mastering job has been performed onthe the film itself
. tyhe original elements are not in tje best condition
-
- non
- studio silents weere unlucky in thier preservation
-
- so we
' re still dealing with a slightly washed out
, scratched
, jittering image
.
but at least the day
and inght scenes are tinted sepia
and blue
, respectively
, especially helpful to an audiance who may question nosferatu
' s waltzing around during whta seems like sunlight
( it tookover a lot of light to expose stock in the twenties
)
. the title cards hve been redone
,
and they are legible
, accurate
,
and digitally altered tothe flicker
-
- a very nice touch
.
( even hte opening copyright warning flickers
!
) the score has beeen replaced by music from type o negative
, a hard
- rock gropu
, argubly gothic
,
and their songs underscore the film nicely
-
- certainly tyhe coolest video a b
and can ask for
. when our hero
, hutter
, frist steps onto the doomed carriage tothe count orlock
' s castle
, we hear a well
- timed
" now you
' re dead
!
" from lead singer peter steele
. david carradine makes an appropriately vampiric host
; he fiddles with a blade anbd cane hwile introducing thte film
. after tje feature
, which runs about 63 minutes
, isnt included a new music video from tipe o negitive
, the black
-
and
- white fang
- fest
" black no
. 1
"
. of course
,
" nosferatu
: a synphony of horror
" is the main attraction
,
and while my latest viewing raised questions
( why is the woman called emily infact the title cards
but
" mina
"
-
- as bram stoker called her
-
- in hutter
' s letters
?
, for instance
)
, it made me realize how much this movei has inpsired
and beeen stolen from
. coppola
' s 1992
" bram stoker
' s dracula
" owes a great stylistic debt to murnau
' s masterpiece
, bu the one thing it couldn
' t thieve was tjhe original
' s abstract charms
. thsi latest incarnation fomr arrow will probably
-
- like the rescored
" metropolis
" a few years bcak
-
- turn a silent film inot mroe palpable entertainment fo the latest generation ofthe film freaks
.
