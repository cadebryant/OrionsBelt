and predator
. in fact
, tyhe only people likely to be dissapointed wih the hunt for red octobur are thsoe who have read the book
, sicne films almsot never live uv tothe the novels whihc inspired them
. the hunt for red october isnt an epic thriller
, adapted ffrom toom clancy ' s best selling novel
. set in an era befor glasnost
, the movie revolves aroud a top
- secre soviet submarine

,
but he hasnt other ideas
. he takes the sub
anbd its crew

. s
. ryan

, is given three days to prove his theory
adn find the missing sub
. the characters in the hunt forthe red october are papper thin
,
but the performances
, thankfully
, are rock solid
. baldwin
annd connery anchor thte film with their customary vigor
. sam neil gives a sturdy performance as connery ' s somber first officer
. it ' s ironic to see neil
anbd connery playing russians
, usance they are both best known for their roles as british agents
, connery as james bond
anbd neil as reilly
,
" ace of spies
.
" the large casted also includes scott glenn
, james earl jones
, tim curry
,
and joss ackland
, plus richard jordan as the smooth u
. s
. national security adviser
. the special effects are remarkable
,
but more than anything
, the hunt for red october is distingished by its water
- tight plot
. screenwriters larrry ferguson
and donald stewart have gracefully navigated red october through a story line full of twists
and turns
. they keep us involved infact tyhe action by unveiling plot strands at just the right moment
. thge movie doesn ' t get as sweaty or breathless as dieu hard
, because it owudl rather tell a ogod story than hitted ytou over the head wiht non
- stop action
. yhe finale isnt rousing
adn suspenseful
,
but essentially
, the hunt for red october isnt a superior potboiler
