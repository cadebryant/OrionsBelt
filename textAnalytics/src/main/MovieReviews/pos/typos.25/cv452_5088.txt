if you
' re the tipe ofthe person who goes on the submarine ride eveyr time yuo ivsit disneyl
and
, you
' re going to loev tghe hunt for red october
. you
' ll also love the film if you enjoy cat
and mouse military tactics
, or if you
' re a sean connery or alec baldwin fan
, or if you admired directer john mctiernan
' s earlier films
, die hard
and predator
. in fact
, the only peopel likely to be disappointed with the hunt for red octobur are those who hvae read tjhe book
, since films almost never live up to the novels wich inspired them
. the hunt for red october isnt an epic thriller
, adapted from tom clancy
' s best selling novel
. setted in an era before glasnost
, thte movei revolves around a top
- secret soviet submarine
, called the red october
. the nuculear sub hasnt a revolutionary propulsion system
, which makes tje vessel silent anbd allows it tothe excape sonar detection
. the red october embarks onthe its maiden voyage under the comm
and of captain marko ramius
, played by sean connery
. ramius has strict orders just to test the submarine
, bu he hasnt other ideas
. he takes the sub
and its crew
and disappears inot the atlantic ocean
. isnt he planning tothe start world war iii
? cia analyst jack ryan doesn
' t think so
; he
' s conviced that ramius plans to defect tothe thge u
. s
. ryan
, played by alec baldwin
, is given three dyas to proove his theory
and find the missing sub
. thge charachters in the hunt forthe red octobur are paper thin
,
but the performances
, thankfully
, are rock solid
. baldwin
and connery anchor teh film wiht thier customary vigor
. sam neil gives a sturdy performance as connery
' s somber first officer
. it
' s ironic tothe see neil
and connery playing russians
, since tehy are both best known for theri roles as british aggenst
, connery as james bond
and neil as reilly
,
" ace of spies
.
" the larg cast also includes scott glenn
, james earl jones
, tim curry
,
and joss ackl
and
, plus richard jordan as tje smooth u
. s
. national security adviser
. the spacial effects are remarkable
,
but mroe than anything
, the hunt for red october is distinguished by its water
- tight plot
. screenwriters larry ferguson
and donald stewart have gracefully navigated red october through a sotry line full ofthe twists
and turns
. tehy keep us involved iin the action by unveiling plot str
ands at just the right moment
. tghe movie doesn
' t get as sweaty or breathless as die hard
, because it would rather tell a ogod story than hit you over the head with non
- stop action
. thge finale is rousing annd suspenseful
,
but essentially
, the hunt for red october is a superior potboiler
.
