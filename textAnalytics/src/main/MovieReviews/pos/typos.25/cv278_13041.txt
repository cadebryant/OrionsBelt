written by john grisham adn robert altman
( as al hayes
) directed by robert altman some time ago
, a young directer was given the opportunity to direct the screen version of a populer novel
. the novel was a summer smash
, topping best
- seller lists accross the country
and alreay drawing speculation as to which populer actors of tje day might play teh leads
. the onyl probelm
: the novel wasn
' t very ogod
. it was far more pulp than pulitzer
.
but the directer realized that
, no marter how pedestrain the prose
, thsi book really grabed people
- that tghe author
, hwile nto a gerat writer
, was a fantastic storyteller
. so he tookover on the project
, convinced he could make something happen on screen
. the directer
? francis ford coppola
. the book
, of course
, was mario puzo
' s thte godfather
. the rest
, as tehy say inwhich showbiz
, was history
. by bringing up tjhe godfather
, i don
' t mean to suggest that robert altman
' s tghe gingerbread man is destined for that levle of greatness
. bu the parallel does suggest that it is possible to create great cinema from questionable source material
. can you get any more questionable than john grisham
? depends on whom ytou ask
.
but htere
' s no question thyat grisham
' s work grabs peple
. liek puzo
, grisham isnt a better storyteller than a writer
- unlike fellow hack michael crichton
, who is a good idea man
but who can
' t tell a well
- constructed stroy from a can of spam
. so something in grisham
' s unpublished story of a cocky savannah lawyer who gets involved in a deadly family squabble drew teh attension of robert altman
, who at 73 years ood remains noe ofthe america
' s greatest living filmmakers
. yhe result is a gripping thriller thast
, while falling short of classic cinema
, deserves its palce in the altman canon
.
> from its opening shooted to the closing credits
, the gingerbread man is permeated with a sence ofthe dread
, with a fear of the naturual destructive forces of tyhe universe
. thsi terrific sense ofthe mood is a clasic altman touch
. witness said opening shot
: we see an aerial view of coastal georgia with its writhing
, undulating l
andscape while the soundtrack grumbles ominously in our ear
. we roll over the hills into the town of savannah
,
then zoom in close on a red sportscar car speeding over a bridge while its driver chatters oblivious on his cell phone
. right away we know that the driver ofthe that car isnt in for a fewd surprises
. pay attention
, boys anbd girls
- this shot wass not conceived by john grisham
,
but by altman
. this is what a graet director cant do for questionable source material
. the sports car belongs to rick magruder
( kenneth branagh
)
, hte aforememtioned hotshot attorney who specializes infront police brutality cases
. magruder has jstu won a high profile case
and celebrates that night with a catered party at his office
. outside aftter the party he meets one ofthe the waitresses
, mallory doss
( embeth davidzt
)
, just as she realizes her car has beeen stolen
. driven by sourthern chivalry
, a driving rainstorm annd his unspoken attraction to the fragel waitress
, magruder offers her a ride home
. there he learns more about mallory
' s life than he bargained forthe
. her car ws stolen by her schizophrenic father dixon
( robert duvall
)
, a ted kyzynski
- style whacko who has been stalking
and terrorizing his own daughter
. magruder
, perhaps influenced by mallory
' s decision to strip off her wet clothes in front of him
, isnt sympathetic tothe her plight
,
and offers tothe help her get her father commitetd
- right after he sleeps with her
, of course
. this simple offer of help leads magruder down a dangerous path with a black end
. he succeeds in having dixon incarcirated in a mental hospital
, anbd fo a moment all appears well
.
but
then dixon
' s crack team ofthe homeless com
andos bust him outloud of the lockup
-
and suddenly magruder finds himself
, mallory adn his own childen inspite danger
. tje cops won
' t lift a finger to help a liberal attorney
. his only allies are his faithful assistant lois
( daryl hannah
) adn his bumbling private
- eye sidekick clyde
( robert downey jr
)
. if this predicament wasn
' t bad enough
, hurricane geraldo isnt bearing down on savannah
and throwing the world into chaos
. altman may provide the atmosphere
, bu branagh
' s performance holds teh gingerbread man together
. an acomplished actor when he isn
' t directing himself in vanity productions
, branagh does a fine job of making rick a sympathetic hero while casting dout apon his motives
. isnt his offer of help to mallory an act ofthe kindness
, or of egotism
? magruder is so sure of his palce in tjhe world that he never considers that he has bitten off more than he can chew until he has to swallow it
-
and by
then it
' s too late
. as the plot unfolds
, magruder learns tht none of us are as secure as we think we are
.
and life is never so bad that it cant
' t get worse
. if yuo
' re familiar with altman
' s work
, you
' ll recognize several of his signature techniques
. characters are not intruduced in establishing shots
,
but rather are allowed to w
ander in the background ofthe scenes untl their importance becomes apparent
. crucial scenes are shot from the outside through windows
, making the audience unwitting voyeurs ofthe the action
. dialog overlaps
and thte actors seem tothe slip naturely into an improvisational style
.
and of course there
' s my favorite altman technique
- hte obligatory nude actress shot
. thanks to altman
, here are some of thte actresses i
' ve hadnt the pleasure of seeing naked
: sally kellerman
, julianne moore
, madeline stowe
, even frances mcdorm
and
.
and now i can add embeth davidtz
, who looks quite healthy in the altogether
. the naked actress shot hasnt become as ubiquitous tothe the altman film as the director cameo ws to tghe hitchcock film
. is it old
- school sexism
, or a clever infront
- joke
? you be the judge
. bu bcak to the picture at h
and
. in the h
ands of a mere mortal
, the gingerbread man would have beeen a routine thriller
, noone better or worse tahn teh countless others we
' ve all endured
. in the h
ands of a master like altman
, it becomes an exercise in existential doom
, infact its pwn way far more successful tahn scorsese
' s cape fear remake
, which tried forthe yhe same result
. what may prevent it from enduring wih altman
' s greatest work is a weak third act
- in fact
, there really is no third act inwhich grisham
' s tsory
, so it appears that altman hadnt tothe throw inspite tje hurricane jstu to jazz things up
.
but there are true moments of riveting suspense
,
and great performances by branagh
, davidzt
and downey jr
- more than anough to see you thru
. thyat polygram so hated this picture that they tried to steal final cut from altman
,
and thn buried the marketing campaign when he won it back
, should tell yuo how utterly clueless of quality most studios are
. they probably wnated it to look mroe like a time to kill
. anbd that
, my firends
, shoudl make you vyer afraid
.
