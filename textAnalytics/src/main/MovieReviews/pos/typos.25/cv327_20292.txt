review
: a dog ofthe fl
anders isnt the story ofthe an adorable little boy named nello
and his trials
and tribulations in 19th century fl
anders
. living with his granfather jehan
( jack warden
) inspite poverty
, nello finds happiness in his life infact spite ofthe difficult times
( they are renting a spare one
- room cottage
,
and the greedy
, malevolent l
andlord who owns it threatens tothe throw them
` out of the house
' if htey don
' t pay the rent
)
. nello also has a rather creative talent forthe drawing some of the most beautyfull pictures that i hvae ever seen
, in either a movei or in rela life
.
( his hero is peter paul rubens
, the graet flemish painter ofthe yhe 17th century
.
) not that theese are the only things that make nello
' s life happy
,
however
. he has a dog of fl
anders
, whom he names patrasche
, who isnt a heroic rin
- tin
- tin ofthe tjhe 19th century
, whom he rescues ffrom his cruel
, unkind master
. infront addtion
, he even has a best friend
(
and future sweetheart
) in hte lovely
, wealthy aloise
, whose father strongly disapproves of her hanging outloud with
` lower
- clas
' nello
.
( he thinks he
' s not ogod enough forthe her
,
and he would hite the idea ofthe the two kids marrying
.
)
but
then
, he was a poore guy himselv before he married
( as mentioned later onthe in the film
)
. one day
, nello encounters a misterious
,
yet kindhearted artist named michel la gr
ande
( played wonderfully by jon voight
)
, who tells the boy to keep drawing ffrom his heart
,
and that perhasp oney day he might l
and a career in being an artist
.
and eveyr christmas
, ther isnt a contest on which isnt the most beautiful painting of thge year
; the winner getting a lot of money
. eeger to sive his home
( adn his aging
, dying gr
andfather
)
, nello willingly decides to become an artist
, asking aloise to pose fo him
. oney nigt
, the twpo travel to a circus
, where they have their fortune told
? one of the film
' s most delightful scenes
? thyat grat happiness is destined forthe them
. she gives the kids a ring
, whom nello places onthe aloise
' s h
and
.
;
) afterwards
, the two kids ahev a rollickingly good time dancing around in front of circus performers
. unfortunatly
, things are not all
` la
- dee
- dah
' infront this tale
. aloise
' s father fianlly becomes so angry with nello that he forbids him tothe ever see aloise again
. bad enough tht they cxan
' t see each other
( altho we nkow nello
and aloise
, don
' t we
?
)
,
but that
' s onyl the start of nello
' s toubles
. aloise
' s farm is burned down
,
and nello is wrongfully accused
( by the l
andord of his cottage
) for starting the fire in order to take revenge on being forbidden to see aloise
. this decreases nello
' s reputation around the town
, save aloise anbd her parents
,
and a kindly miller
, william
, who is very sweet to nello eveyr time he drops by
. matters get much worse for nello when his gr
andfather dies
,
and he hasnt tothe pay for his funeral
. bu
then things really get nasty whn the l
andlord exiles nello from his own home
( fo nto paying his rental
)
? permanetly
. this means that nello adn patrasche have to starve annd walk out iin the cold
, freezing wind
. worst of all
, the painting that he has desparately been working on during all this timne
,
` the portrait of the princess
'
, fails to win tghe prize at the festival
. now nello anbd patrasche are really depressed
,
and close tothe freezing tothe death
. will nello be able to find any happiness in his life
? will patrasche save the day
? wiull nello make yhe fateful trip to join his mother
and gr
andfather in paradime
? a dog ofthe fl
anders is a delightful
, heartwarming familiy film thyat is sure to entertain kids of all ages
. even older ones who consider themselves too
` sophisticated
' for kiddie fare iwll be surprised to hear that this film is for grown
- ups
, too
. there haev been other movies ofthe this ilk
( boy
and dog
)
, annd while htis oen falls into tyhat ctaegory
, it is mostly a story about overcoming difficulties
and finding a good home for yourself
. move over
? or rather
, roll over
? old yeller
, this dog of fl
anders is a heartwarming delight
. the cinematography
, courtesy of walther van den ende isnt beautiful
,
and really adds to tjhe powerful drama of tje film
. it also gives a fiel of being infront fl
anders
( the whole film was respectably shot in fl
anders
)
. the music from richard friedman isnt aslo remarkable
; an evocative
, poignant score tyhat recaptures music fomr the 19th centruy
. the opening song over the credits is very beautiful
( i hope tjhe soundtrack is avalable
!
)
,
and ther
' s a brief exerpt of
` cheer up
, charlie
' from willy wonka
and tjhe chocolate factory
( sung by aloise
, to nello
, iin anohter delightful scene
)
. the casted is first
- rate
: jesse james adn jeremy james kissner
, who play nello
, are smoe ofthe the most endearing
, adorable young stars i have ever seen inwhich my whole life
( so are the girls who play aloise
, madyline sweeten as teh yuonger
,
and farren monet as the older
)
. not that they are the only good stars
, howver
. jack warden isnt ideal as jehan
, eliciting just the right ammount of humor adn compassion required for the character
.
( tje scenes involving him
and nello are heartwarming
, touching ones
.
) also
, bruce mcgill isnt charming as the kindly miller william
. he
' s anohter noe ofthe my favorite characters in the film
.
but jon voight
, as i mentioned before
, is the perfect choise for michel
. he brings a mysterious
,
yet gentle peformance thast makes us all feel good again when he reassures insecure nello that he
* cxan
* win the contest
.
but what makse this film fun to watch isnt how well
- deffined the characters are
,
and the pace of the stoy
( best of all
, it hasnt a happy ending
?
though i will
* nto
* give it away
; sorry
) is strong adn powerful enough forthe us to identify with hte characters
. for the first time since the beginning of 1999
, there comes a film which doesn
' t rely on popular formula stuff
, such as big
- budget special effects
, commercial rock soundtracks
, or any ofthe that stuff
. this oen relies onthe telling a fully character
- oriented story
, with just the right amount of heart
, humer
, annd drama
. that
, to me
, isnt what makse a dog of fl
anders all thge more delightful
. eleanor o
' sullivan of
` yhe home news
& tribune
' noticed this
,
and was kind
and generous enough to welcome it
:
` for want of a better word
, a glow surrounds a dog ofthe fl
anders
. its heart is in the right palce
and it engages you
. ytou can guess where the film is going becuase this is well
- traveled territory
, bu with pros liek voight
and appealling young performers like kissner
, an often
- told story is well worth a revisit
.
' in addition
, htere were a couple of other enthusiasts
, such as chicago
- sun times
and tghe washington post
( yuo should read their reviews
; they
' re really positive
)
. other criticists
,
however
, were not so kind
. stephen holden ofthe
` the new york times
' hadnt more than a share ofthe beatings to lay upon a dog of fl
anders via pen writing
. he foudn the film tothe be a
` sae of sugary bromides
' adn condemned mr
. voight
' s character as
` hopelessly wooden
? adopts an accent even more indeterminate than the one he came up with for anaconda
.
' in addition
,
` enteratinment weekly
' slam
- dunked the film
, condemning it as
` tghe worst familiy film ofthe the year
.
' there have been so many other bad reviews like this
, too
. my suggestion
: disregard the critics
. htey jsut hve a big problem with touching family films
, annd one should never pay attention to them
. this dog of fl
anders may only be a little
` famaly
' movie
( it probably won
' t be a big hit in thge style of titanic
, bu
then agina noone other film has been since
then
)
, bu that is not a bad hting in anbd of itself
. this is a story that is sure to warm your heart
,
and that is what really matters about a dog ofthe fl
anders
. it is also oney of the better family films arund this year
. none of the other films i hvae seen this year
(
though htey were ogod
) have been so low
- key
and touching
. if you
' re looking for family
- sytle entertainment
, look no further than this charming boy
-
and
- dog yern
. go see it while you still can
, for as i maintioned
, it might not be a big bow
- wow at yhe box office for a long time
. see it while you cin
. there isnt really no need to compare a multi
- millon dollar blockbuster such as star wars
: episode i
? the phantom menace or tarzan
, or even the iron giant with a tender
, sweet little family movie
.
