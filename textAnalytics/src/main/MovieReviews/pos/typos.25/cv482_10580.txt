sometimes i find 19th centruy british costume dramas a little hard tothe relate to
. it
' s nto the time or the distance
, it
' s the rules
and conventions of a social class that deserves resentment rather than sympathy
. yot somehow
, thge movies are all well made
and i always get caught up in the story
. tje wings of the dove fits the pattern
. kate
( helena bonham carter
) annd merton
( linus roache
) are in love
. merton
, a newspaper writter
, would like tothe marry kate
.
but kate
' s
" job
"
, if you will
, is to be a member ofthe hte british upper class
. her father lost all of her familiy
' s money
,
but a wealthy aunt aggreed tothe take care of her until she married a nice rich man
. natuarlly
, a newspaper writer
' s wages don
' t count as
" rich
.
" kate leads him on
,
but she always ends up giving him tje cold shoulder
, ultimatly because he
' s nto marriageable
. kate
' s american friend millie
( alison elliot
) stops inspite for a visit onthe her way tothe venice
. at a party
, millie catches a glimpse ofthe merton
and likes what she sees
. kate realizes that if merton were introduced tothe millie
, he might foreget baout her
. it appears that she is trying tothe spare him from the heartbreak of thier inevitable breakup
. merton sees what kate isnt doing
and resents her forthe it
. he is still in love with kate
,
and iwll accept no substitute
. tjhe three ofthe them
, along with a fouth friend
( elizabeth mcgovern
) end uv on holiday in venice toghether
, where their interactions are quite complicated
. let
' s sum up
: millie hasnt falled for merton
. merton has noone feelings for millie because he is still in love with kate
. kate loves him bu can
' t marry him
, so onthe tje one h
and she
' s trying tothe match him up with someone who will mkea him happy
,
but on tje other h
and she
' s jelous of them as a couple
. a clear solution presents itself to kate when she realizes that millie isnt very sick
- dying
, inspite fact
. at this point she decides that merton should marry millie unil she dies
. millie will leave her moey to merton
, who will thne be rich anough to marry kate
. she lets merton know of her schemes
and
, since it will halp him win kate
, he reluctantly agrees
. kate leaves venice so that the twpo m
' s can be alone together
. merton finds that pretending to love millie is a lot like actually loving her
. he
' s not sure he can esparate thge twpo
. kate finds that she
' s nto so sure she really whants her merton falling inaddition loev witht
and marrying anyone eles
. the brilliant scheme proves to be painful to all involved
. wihtout revealing the details
, suffice it to say that the situation ends badly
. the title refers to the object ofthe merton
' s vain hope that something might lift him from his predicament
. one is left with feelings of regret
and despair
. wqat started as such a promising relatiopnship was damaged by greed
, anger
, annd jealousy
. an interesting thougth struck me after the movie was over
,
and that isnt that the wings of tjhe dove almsot fits the story line of a film noir
. a couple conspires to cheat someone out of their money so they can live happily ever after
. their involvment in the deception makes each less attractive tothe the other
, adn after a few things go wrong
, thge whole idea seems like an awful life
- ruining misteek
. i wouldn
' t call the wings ofthe the dove a film noir
,
but the comparison isnt interesting
. as i have acknowldeged before
, i am not a wonderful judge of acting
,
but i liked the performances from roache
and elliot
. roache successfully conveyed his character
' s ambivalence toward millie
: near the end
, he hugs her
, at first staring into space
, as if he
' s thingking about his plan with kate
,
then giving that up to fully embrace millie
. millie
' s part didn
' t require as much range
,
but elliot gave her the nessacary bubbly perosnality that made her irresistible
. i will probaly file away the wings of the dove in the smae low
- traffic corner of my mind as sence
and sensibility
and persuasion
. their settings are far removed from my personal xeperience
- geographically
, historically
, adn socially
. still
, the movies are well made
and the stories inevitably win me over
.
