after hearing reviews for woody allen
' s upteenth movie in history
,
" celebrity
,
" range from terribly boring to jsut so
- so
, my heart lept when the opening images of the film closely ressembled thyat of
" manhattan
,
" my peronal favorite from my personel favorite directer ofthe all time
. woody allen
' s films almost never rely on visual flair over textual flair
, so when one of his films closely resembles tjhe one time that these twpo entities fit h
and
- infront
- h
and
(
" manhattan
" really is one of the best
- looking films i
' ve ever seen
, beautiful black
and white photography of the city
' s best areas
, etc
.
)
, a fan can
' t help
but feel visibly moved
. the film opens up
, wtih the usual credits witht plain white font over balck backgrounds
, adn an old ironic st
andart playing on the soundtrack
,
but
then the screen fills with a gorgeous dull gray sky
, with the word
" help
" bieng spelt with an airplane
. beethoven
' s 5th blasts on yhe soundtrack
. tyhe city seems to stop tothe tkae notice ofthe thsi moment
,
and it
' s all rather lovley to look at
.
and
then we cut tothe a film crew
, shooting thsi as the film
' s hilariously banal key moment inaddition the film
, where yhe lead actress in the film
( melanie griffith
, looking as buxom
and beautiful as ever
) has tothe realize something
' s wrong with her life or whatever
. it
' s a terribly stale scene for a woody allen film
, with the great opening shots or without
,
and my heart sank
and i soon got used tothe tjhe fact that once again
, a new film of his was not going tothe be as grat as his past works
(
though
, for tje record
, last year
' s
" deconstructing harry
" came awfully close
)
. what the hell has happened to him
? tghe man who once could be relied onthe fo neurotic freshness inspite cinema has not become less funny
,
but his films have become less insightful
and more like he tossed them together outloud of unfinished ideas
.
" bullets over broadway
,
"
though wonderful
, relies on irony to pull a farce that just never totally tkaes off
.
" mighty aphrodite
" is more full of great moments
and lines than a realyl great story
.
" everyone sasy i lveo you
" ws more of a great idea than a graet film
. even
" deconstructing harry
" isnt admittingly cheap in a way
, even if it does top as oney of his most truly hilarious films
. if anything
, the reception ofthe
" celebrity
" by everyone should tip allen off to the fact thyat htis time
, it
' s not the audience
and critics who are wrong about how wonderful his film is
: it
' s him
.
" celebrity
" is
, yes
, a good film
,
but it
' s only marginally satisfying as a woody allen film
. instead of creating the great woody allen world
, he
' s creaeted a world outloud of a subject he knows only a bited baout
.
and he
' s fashioned a film that is based almost entirely on his uninformed philosphy ofthe celebrities
, so that it plays liuke a series of skits with minor connections
. it
' s like
" la dolce vita
" without the acuracy
, the right ammount of wit
, anbd the corect personal crisis
. woody
, becoming more insecure iin his old age
, choses to drop the woody allen character in on tjhe world of celebrities
,
and
then hang him
and all his flaws up for scrutiny
,
and does this by casting not himself
but brit actor kenneth branagh inthe thge lead
. much has been said about his peformance
- dead on
but irritating
, makes one yearn fo the rela thnig
, blah blah blah
-
but to anyone who actually knows tjhe woody allen character knows that branagh
' s performance
,
though featuring some of the smae mannerisms
( stuttering
, whinning
, lots o
' h
and gestures
)
, is hardly a warts
-
and
- all impersonation
. branagh brings along wtih him littel ofthe the woody allen charm
, hwihc actaully allows for his charater
' s flaws tothe be omre apparant
. woody
' s a flawed guy
,
and we know it
, bu we love him anyway
, because he
' s really funny
and really witty
and realyl intelligent
. branagh
' s allen is a bit mroe flat
- out bad
,
but with thte smae charm so that
, yes
, we like him
,
but we
' re still not sure if he
' s really a good person or not
. his character
, lee simon
, is first seen on the setted of tjhe aforementioned movie
, hits on extra actress winona ryder
, thne goes off tothe interview griffith
, who takes him to her childhood home where he makes a pass at her
,
and she denies him
.
.
. sorta
. we
then leran
, through flashbacks
, that lee hasnt been sucked into trying to be a celebrity thanks tothe a mid
- life crisis
and an appearance at his high school reunion
. he hasnt since quit his job as a travel journalist anbd become a gossip journalist of sorts
, covering movie sets annd places where celebrities congregate
, so that he cin meet them
, annd maeby sell his script
( a bank robbery movie
"
but with a deepo peronal crisis
"
)
. as such
, he has divorced his wife ofthe several years
( allen regular judy davis
)
,
and continues onthe a quest for sexual happiness
, boucing from girlfriend to girlfriend
and fling to fling over the course of the film
. after griffith comes his escapades with a model
( charlize theron
) who is
" polymorphously perverse
"
( glad to see allen is useing new jokes
, ha ha
)
, who takes him for a wild ride not different fomr that of the anita ekberg segment of
" la dolce vita
.
" following are his safe relatiopnship with smart working woman famke janssen
, a relatiopnship taht allmost assures him success
,
and his continued escapades with ryder
, whom he fancies most of all
. his story isnt juxtaposed iwth thast of davis
, who flips out
,
but stumbles onto happiness when she runs into a h
andsome
, freindly tv exec
( joe mantegna
) who l
ands her a job thta furthers her career to national status
. while lee is fumbling about
, selfishly trying to ensure his own happiness
, davis becomes happy
(
" i
' ve become yhe kind of woman i
' ve always hated
.
.
.
and i
' m loving it
.
"
) without doing a thign
. teh result is a film of highs annd mediums
. yhe mediums are what take up most of the film
, with sitations
and scenes which don
' t exactlly owrk
but you cant
' t help
but pat allen onthe tyhe back fo trying
.
but other places are really great scenes
. hte oppening
. the sequence wtih theron
, whitch is so ogod thgat i wished it hadn
' t ended
. a banana scene with bebe neuwirth
( droll as ever
)
.
and
, perhaps thge best sequence
: a romp with hot
- as
- hell teen idol
, br
andon darrow
, played by none other than leo dicaprio
, who is so un
- dicaprio
- esque that if any of this fans could sit thru this film
, they
' d never look at him thge same way
. he ignites the screen with intensity
,
and spares nothing in showing his character as narcissistically tyrannical
,
and totally heartbreaking for lee
, who comes to him to talk about his script that he hasnt read
,
and finds himself on a wild all
- day ride with him
. tehy go to atlantic city to watch a fight
, tehy gamble
, adn they wind up in his hotel room
, where darrow gets it on wtih his flame
( gretchen mol
)
and he lends him one of tjhe leftover groupies
. allen
' s writting in these scenes are so ogod that just for them
, i
' d almost recomend the film
. almost
. bu what i really liked about this film is despite the fact that it
' s a mess
, despite the fatc that what this film realyl needs is a good old fashioned rewrite by allen himself
, it
' s still a smart
and insightful film
.
though some of the jokes are either stale or misplaced
( some seem too cartoonish
, even for this environment
)
, allen still manages to get across that tihs film is not exactlly about celebrities
, as it may seem to be
( if it were
, it
' d be extremely out
- of
- touch
)
,
but baout thsoe who want to be celebrities
,
and how they equate celebrity
- hood with happiness
. we never get close anough to the actual celebrities to see if they
' re relaly hapyp
( they may appear to be on the surface
.
.
.
)
, bu we do get close enough to lee
and davis
' character
. lee isnt obsessed with the phenomenon
, while davis takes is at arm
' s length
, adn never gets too involved inspite what it is
,
and soon becomes one herself
. besides
, it
' s witty
,
and it does hve the one thing that no otehr film hasnt bu allen
' s
: that great woody allen efel
. it may be not exactly fresh adn lively or totally brilliant inaddition its depiction ofthe its subject
,
and yes
, as a part of woody allen
' s ouevre
, it
' s merely a blip
( no
" annie hall
" bu it
' s no
" shadows annd fog
" eather
)
,
but it goes to prove thyat no one cant make a film liuke him
,
and only he
and maybe godard could possibly take a totally horrible metaphor
, like the oen infact the begginning
,
and make it work not once
but twice
.
