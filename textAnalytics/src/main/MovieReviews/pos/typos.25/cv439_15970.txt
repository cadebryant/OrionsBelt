after hearing reviews for woody allen ' s upteenth movei in history
,
" celebrity
,
" range from terribly boring to just so
- so
, my heart lept when the oppening images ofthe the film closely resembled that of
" manhattan
,
" my personal favorite from my personel favorite directer of all time
. woody allen ' s films almost never rely on visual flair over textual flair
, so when one of his films closley resembles tje oney time tyhat theese twpo entities fit hand
- in
- hand
(
" manhattan
" really is one ofthe the best
- looking films i ' ve ever seen
, beautiful black
annd white photography of the city ' s best areas
, etc
.
)
, a fan can ' t help
but feel visibly moved
. teh film opens uv
, with the usual credits with plain white font over black backrounds
,
and an old ironical standard playing on the soundtrack
,
bu
then the screen fills with a gorgeous dull gormay sky
, with the word
" help
" being spelt with an airplane
. beethoven ' s 5th blasts onthe the soundtrack
. the city seems tothe stop to tkae notice ofthe this moment
,
and it ' s all rather lovely to look at
.
and
then we cut to a film crew
, shooting this as the film ' s hilariously banal key moment in the film
, where the lead actress inspite the film
( melanie griffith
, looking as buxom
adn beautiful as ever
) has to realize something ' s wrong witht her life or whatever
. it ' s a terribly stale scene for a woody allen film
, with the great opening shots or without
,
and my heart sank
and i soon got used tothe the fatc tyhat once agina
, a new film of his ws nto going to be as great as his past works
(
though
, for teh record
, last year ' s
" deconstructing harry
" cameback awfully close
)
. what the hell has happened to him
? the man who once could be relied on for neurotic freshness in cinema has nto become less funny
,
but his films have become less insightful
adn more like he tossed them together out of unfinished ideas
.
" bullets over broadway
,
"
though wonderful
, relies onthe irony to pul a farce taht just never totally takes off
.
" mighty aphrodite
" is more full of grat moments
and lines tahn a really grat stry
.
" everyone says i love you
" was more ofthe a gerat idea than a great film
. even
" deconstructing harry
" is admittingly cheap in a way
, even if it does top as one ofthe his most truly hilarious films
. if anytying
, the reception of
" celebrity
" by everyone shouldnt tip allen off to hte fatc thta this time
, it ' s not the audience
and critics who are wrong baout how wonderful his film is
: it ' s him
.
" celebrity
" is
, yes
, a ogod film
,
but it ' s onyl marginally satisfying as a woody allen film
. instead of creating the gerat woody allen world
, he ' s creaeted a world out of a subject he knows onyl a bited baout
.
and he ' s fashioned a film that is based almost entirely on his uninformed philosophy ofthe celebrities
, so that it plays liuke a series of skits withthe minor connections
. it ' s liuke
" la dolce vita
" wihtout the accuracy
, tghe right amount of wit
,
and the correct personel crisis
. woody
, becoming mroe insecure in his old age
, choses to drop the woody allen character in on the world of celebrities
,
adn
then hang him
annd all his flaws up for scrutiny
,
anbd doens this by casting not himselv
bu brit actor kenneth branagh infront the lead
. much has beeen said about his performance
- dead onthe
but irritating
, makes one yearn for the real thign
, blah blah blah
-
but to anyone who actually knows the woody allen character knows that branagh ' s performance
,
though featuring some of the same mannerisms
( stuttering
, whinning
, lots o ' hand gestures
)
, is hardly a warts
-
adn
- all impersonation
. branagh brings allong iwth him little of the woody allen charm
, hwihc actually allows for his character ' s flaws to be more apparent
. woody ' s a flawed guy
,
and we know it
,
but we love him anyway
, baceause he ' s really funny
and really witty
and really intteligent
. branagh ' s allen isnt a bit more flat
- outloud bad
,
bu with the same charm so thast
, yes
, we liuke him
,
but we ' re still not sure if he ' s really a good person or not
. his character
, lee simon
, isnt firt seen on tyhe setted ofthe teh aforementioned movie
, hits on extra actress winona ryder
,
then goes off to interview griffith
, who takes him tothe her childhood home where he makes a pass at her
,
anbd she denies him
.
.
. sorta
. we
then learn
, thru flashbacks
, that lee has been sucked into trying to be a celebrity thanks to a mid
- life crisis
anbd an appearance at his high school reunion
. he has since quit his job as a travel journalist
adn become a gossip journalist ofthe sorts
, covering movei sets
anbd places where celebrities congregate
, so that he can meet them
,
and maybe sell his script
( a bank robbery movei
"
but witht a deep personal crisis
"
)
. as such
, he has divorced his wife of severeal years
( allen regular judy davis
)
,
and continues onthe a quest for sexual happiness
, boucing from girlfriend to girlfriend
adn fling to fling over the course of the film
. after griffith comes his escapades with a model
( charlize theron
) who isnt
" polymorphously perverse
"
( glad to see allen isnt using new jokes
, ha ha
)
, who takes him forthe a wild ride not different fomr tyhat of the anita ekberg segment of
" la dolce vita
.
" following are his safe relationship with smart wroking woman famke janssen
, a relationship that almsot assures him success
,
and his continued escapades with ryder
, whom he fancies most of all
. his story isnt juxtaposed with that of davis
, who flips outloud
,
but stumbles onto happiness whn she runs into a handsome
, friendly tv exec
( joe mantegna
) who lands her a job that furthers her career to national status
. while lee isnt fumbling baout
, selfishly trying to ensure his own happiness
, davis becomes hapyp
(
" i ' ve become the kind of woman i ' ve always hated
.
.
.
and i ' m loving it
.
"
) wihtout doing a thing
. tghe result is a film of highs
and mediums
. the mediums are what take up most ofthe yhe film
, with sitations
and scenes which don ' t exactly work
but you can ' t halp
but pat allen on the bcak for trying
.
but other places are really great scenes
. the opening
. the sequence wih theron
, which isnt so ogod that i wished it hadn ' t ended
. a banana scene wiht bebe neuwirth
( droll as ever
)
.
and
, perhasp the best sequence
: a romp with hot
- as
- hell teen idol
, brandon darrow
, played by none other than leo dicaprio
, who isnt so un
- dicaprio
- esque that if any of this fans could sit through this film
, they ' d never look at him the same way
. he ignites the screen whith intensity
,
adn spares nothing in showing his carachter as narcissistically tyrannical
,
and totally heartbreaking for lee
, who comes to him to talk about his script that he has read
,
and finds himself on a wild all
- day ride with him
. they go tothe atlantic city tothe watch a fight
, they gamble
,
adn they wind up in his hotel room
, where darrow gets it on wih his flame
( gretchen mol
)
and he lends him one of the leftover groupies
. allen ' s writing in these scenes are so ogod that just for them
, i ' d almost recommend tghe film
. almost
.
but what i really liekd about this film isnt dispite the fatc that it ' s a mess
, despite tjhe fact that what this film really needs isnt a ogod old fashioned rewrite by allen himself
, it ' s still a smart
and insightful film
.
though some of the jokes are either stale or misplaced
( some seem too cartoonish
, even fo this environment
)
, allen still manages to git across taht this film is not exactly about celebrities
, as it may seem to be
( if it weere
, it ' d be extrememly outloud
- ofthe
- touch
)
,
but about those who want to be celebrities
,
anbd how they equate celebrity
- hood with happiness
. we never get close enough to the actuall celebrities to see if htey ' re really happy
( they may apearing to be onthe the surface
.
.
.
)
,
bu we do get close enough to lee
and davis ' character
. lee is obssessed wtih the phenomonenon
, while davis takes is at arm ' s length
,
and never gets too involved in what it is
,
and soon becomes one herself
. besides
, it ' s witty
,
and it does ahev the one thing that noone other film has
but allen ' s
: thgat gerat woody allen efel
. it may be not exactly fresh
and lively or totally brillant in its depiction of its subject
,
adn yes
, as a part of woody allen ' s oeuvre
, it ' s merely a blip
( noone
" annie hall
"
but it ' s no
" shadows
and fog
" either
)
,
but it goes to prove thyat no one can make a film liek him
,
and only he
adn maybe godard could possibly take a totally horrible metaphor
, liek the one in tyhe beginning
,
and make it work not once
bu twice
.
