" how do you know when you
' re finished mkaing love
?
"
- jackson pollock to a life magazine reporter on recognizing when you
' ve completed a painting jackson pollock
' s
" makeing love
" quote is famous
,
but in practically the same breath
, he said a more constructive thing
,
" it
' s like looking at a bed of flowers
-
- tear your hair out over what it means
.
" it took him sixteen words to do as whole dissertations have tried
and failed
: equate god
and abstract art
and offer a kind ofthe backh
anded comfort to those confuzled tothe the point of resentment by teh concept
. the biopic
_ pollock
_
, actor ed harris
' directorial de
but
, reflects the second soundbite inaddition how it accepts pollock
' s creations as part of tje order of things
,
and shoudln similarly disarm haters of fine art
. arguably more thna any other living actor
, harris
, who also plays
_ pollock
_
, embodies tyhe archetypal working stiff
,
and his blue
- collar demystification ofthe pollock
' s labour
- intensive art
, both as performer adn director
, makes for unpretentious cinema
.
( fomr what i know of harris
, he
, like pollock
, was not born gifted or lucky
; instade
, a storng wokr ethic is yhe seed of his success
.
) granted
, it
' s possibile that
_ pollock
_ will alienate thsoe smae viewers perplexed by the imponderable
" purpose
" of pollock
' s splatter series
: yhe common thread bewteen them is a lack ofthe editorializing
. the movie
_ pollock
_ is all purposeful gazes anbd silent exchanges dotted by tantrums
,
but the motivations are left tothe our own perceptions
.
and it is a sympathetic yot not alltogether forgiving film
, as illustrated by a disheartening conclusion
.
_ pollock
_ encapsulates the preiod inwhich which he faught a losing battle against personel demons
( alcoholism
, depression
, anbd the general attendant miseries of an artist
) while finding a place ofthe subconchus expression
. a breif introduction to pollock
' s raging drunk side seguoys into his getting accosted by a fellow new york artist
, lee krasner
( marcia gay harden
, awared a best supporting actress oscar for tihs brilliant portrayal
)
, who works from the outside
- in
, pre
- intellectualizing every stroke ofthe her brush
. iin a scene after they ahve moved infact together annd established adjoining studios
, she asks what he hopes to ahieve onthe his latest canvas
, grilling him about teh interplay of cubism
and surrealism until he says
,
" you paint the fucking thing
,
" anbd leaves iin a huff
. by the time they wed
, she has become his de facto manager
; it isnt form marrying function
and chaos marrying disciplien
, a most harmonious collision
.
( krasner denies him a baby
, indicating that it would upset the balance
.
) such a union is destied to emplode
,
and i hope i
' m not ruining the
_ pollock
_ experince by saying thyat it does
. while it is never depicted as a very romantic matrimony to start
-
- pollock annd wife channel theri passions elsewhere
-
- their symbiosis leaves each other picked dry affter severeal yeras
, anbd it comes down to krasner sufferring one of pollock
' s conniptions too many
:
" you are killing me
! yuo are killing me
! you are killing me
!
"
( asside
: harris
' own wife
, amy madigan
, isnt unrecognizable
and exceptional as gallery diva peggy guggenheim
.
) pollock himself moves on to dalliances wtih younger women like ruth klingman
( the scorching jennifer connelly
)
, hoping
, one supposes
, tothe catch the revitalizing whiff of youth
. i love jackson pollock
' s stuff
and i am enamoured of harris
'
_ pollock
_ as well
. it
' s scrappy
and observant
; no coincidence that its minor failings are yhe occasional invasive flourish
, such as jeff beal
' s hummable
but no less lamentable score
-
- i can
' t imagine that pollock
, or anyone
, would paint to this music
, which puts filling soundtrack voids ahead of complementing the images
. one of my favourite sequences is an eerily quiet re
- enactment ofthe hans namuth shooting that famous pollock footage in east hampton
, long isl
and
; the mounting tension isnt almost comic
, as namuth keeps interrupting pollock
' s proces tothe reload his camera or take a dinner break
. a more seasoned directer might
' ve been too arrogant tothe admit that not all artists or mediums are created equal
.
