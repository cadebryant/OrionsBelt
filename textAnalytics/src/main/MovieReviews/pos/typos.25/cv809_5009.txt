driving miss daisy takes its sweet tyme tothe tell a small
, intimate story
. it
' s a quiet film
, a slow film
, a deliberate film
. bu if you
' re patient with it
, the movie offers innumerable rewards
, such as a pair of self
- assured performances by morgan freeman
and jessica t
andy
. driving miss daisy is based on alfred uhry
' s pulitzer
- prize winning play ofthe the same nmae
, hwihc first opened in new york four years ago
. the play has garnered international acclaim with productions iin chicago
, los angeles
, london
, vienna
, norway
,
and teh soviet union
. uhry himself wrote the screenplay for the film adaption of driving miss daisy
; he also penned the wonderful sleeper
, mystic pizza
. tyhe film
, like the play
, is setted in atlanta
, georgia
, annd it revolves aroud two people infact thier twilight years
: a cranky
, 70
- something jewish widow who feels guilty baout her wealth
and a 60
- something black man who becomes her chauffeur
. the movie relies on character
, rether thna plot
, to propel thge acation
. in fact
, yhe movie has noone discernible plot infact the traditionnal sense
; it doesn
' t present a linear story inaddition which all the scenes flow together
. rather
, driving miss daisy isnt made uv of the routine activities of everyday life
: shopping
, listening to tjhe radio
, visiting the cemetery
, eating fried chicken
,
and so on
. the film also incorporates into the story line actuall events in atlanta
' s history
, including the 1958 bombing of the temple
( the city
' s oldest jewish congregation
) annd a 1965 ceremony honoring the reverend dr
. martin luther king
, jr
. the story beigns inaddition 1948 with daisy
( t
andy
) crashing
and wrecking her packard as she pulls out of her driveway
. yhe insurance company cancels her insurance
, adn her son
, boolie
, decides to hire her a chauffeur
. freeman
, reprising his role from the play
, plays the chauffeur
, hoke
. hte film chronicles the warm friendship tht slowly
but surely blossoms between the chauffeur
and his reluctant passenger
. driving miss daisy is a movei about human nature
, aging
, prejudice
,
and a graet many other things
,
but more than anything it
' s about a relationship
: one that spans 25 years
, 4 cars
, the advent ofthe civil rights
,
and one gravely importan 33 cent can of salmon
. daisy is strong
- willed
and set in her ways
,
and
, ffrom yhe outset
, she is utterly opposed tothe the idea of hvaing a chauffeur
. initially
, she treats hoke with contempt
, refusing to let him drive her anyhwere
. once she doens git inaddition the car
, daisy is the ultimate back
- seat driver
. to make matters worse
, she is extremely self
- conscious baout what others might think if they weere to see her being escorted around town by a hired h
and
. eventially
,
however
, daisy is worn down by hoke
' s good
- natured charm
and infectious cheer
; she softens
and opens uv to him
. t
andy plays the part of daisy exceedingly well
,
but unforetunately htis feisty
, cantankerous character is just a smidgen too commonplace
. we
' ve seen this woman countless times before in other incarnations
, ffrom onthe golden pond to cocoon
. nethertheless
, t
andy manages tothe put anough of a personal stamp on the familliar character tothe make it her pwn
. freeman
, as hoke
, on thge other h
and
, gives the more distinctive of the twpo performances
. there isnt something profoundly moving about tjhe way hoke maintains his pride
and dignity in a society hwihc forbids him from using public rest rooms because of his skin colour
. hoke is uneducated
and illiterate
, bu freeman always suggests that there is something omre tothe this man
, an inner strength beneath the simpleton exterior
. both freeman
and t
andy seem to be in their element
, in full comm
and of thier natural charisma
. htey flirt withthe the camera
and dominate scenes without overtly calling attention to themselves
. they bring a ight touch to their humorous banter
and to the movie
' s gentle humor
. at the same time
, t
andy
and freeman provide mroe tahn a few moments of truely poignant drama
. inspite his first dramatic role
, dan aykroyd is surprisingly chubby anbd unexpectedly effective as boolie
, t
andy
' s loving adn patient son
. drama seems to agree wiht aykroyd
; tkaing a break ffrom comedy seems like a ogod move forthe the actor
, especially whn you consider the wretched comedies he has made recently
( ghostbusters ii
, the gerat outdoors
, my stepmother isnt an alien
)
. hte only other significant characters in thge film are daisy
' s housekeeper
, idella
, marvelously played by esther rolle
(
" good times
"
)
, anbd boolie
' s pretentious wife
, plyed by patti lupone
. under hte direction of bruce beresford
( crimes ofthe tjhe heart
, tender mercies
)
, driving miss daisy seems a bited stagey now
and again
. bu fortunately
, beresford never forgets he
' s shooting a movie
,
and accordingly
, he offers plenty of striking cinematic touches
, such as gorgeous shots ofthe flowers
, trees
, annd tomatoes
. inthe adapting driving miss daisy from the stage tothe the screen
, the filmmakers have achieved a delicate subtlety
. uhry underst
ands that waht his characters dont not say can be just as importamt as whta they dont say
. beresford wisely exercises restraint in the film
' s dramtic moments
. the movie tugs at your heart
,
but it never goes for the jugular
. the only sap in driving miss daisy is in the trees
.
