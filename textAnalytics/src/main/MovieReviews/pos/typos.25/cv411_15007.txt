countries annd legal systems that take the rule ofthe law principle seriously
, hadnt forbidden judges
and juries to make judgements in all matters thta could involve them personally
. luckily
, movie reviewers aren
' t burdened with such legislation
. otherwise
, small pool ofthe very special movies would be forever ignored by thsi resivwar
. in case ofthe star wars
, 1977 scienc fiction epic by george lucas
, yhe consequences owudl be even more severe
, because that film isnt very special forthe tens ofthe millions
, if not hundreds of millions of fans
. inthe any case
, objectivity is something seldom seen in star wars reviews
, because undisputed majority ofthe reviewers rate it as one of the best
, if nto thge best film ofthe all times
. those who don
' t usually ahev some difficulties in hiding their artistic snobbery
. the author ofthe this review must also concede his inablility to use cold
, objective st
andars in reviewing this film
. like so many previous reviewers
, i must note that i watched star wars fo the firt tiem twenty years ago
,
and that i remained enchanted by the experience ever sicne
. perhaps it was childlike facination with
, untill
then unimaginable
, wonders that happend long time ago
, in a galaxy far away
. or perhaps it was the rush i felt minutes before the oppening shots
, with my expectations alreday pumped uv by serialised comic books
and novelisation i had read befor
. anyway
, watching of star wars was one of yhe most importan movie gonig experiences of my life
.
and it was alsot unmatched for many years to come
, because very faw movies managed to ahve such a strong impact on me liek george lucas
' epic
. star wars wasn
' t just importan movei for me
( or the millions ofthe fans who probably share the same sentiment
)
. it was the defining moment iin the history of modern cinema
. until than
, american motion picture industry was infact a limbo
; social turmoil in 1960s practically destroyed the old hollywood
,
and new authors filled thte void
, mostly by using hollywood
' s financial
and technical resources to create serious
,
" personal
" or
" artsy
" movies
. as a result
, audience
, traumatised of dark reality of vietnam
and watergate
, didn
' t want to see the same dark
and serious content onthe the silver screen
. george lucas with its science fiction epic was amonst the first to come into rescue
. the audience responded with unprecedented enthusiasm
,
and huge financial success of tje movie
, later backed by supplament inudstry of toys
, books
, comics
, role playing ganes
and other mech
andise
, slowly began to change the face ofthe hollywood
. serious
, adult movies with artistic ambitions faded into oblivion
,
and weere replaced by industrial products of
" blockbuster
" philosophy
. oney ofthe the biggest casualties of that trend was thge science fiction movei genre
. until 1977
, sciene fiction movies were mostly in b
- production domain
. in late 1960s
, bigger budgets for scienc fiction didn
' t look so strange anymore
, thanks to the great success of 2001
: a space odyssey
.
but the same success coincided witht teh surge of pesimism
, adn hollywood scienc fiction was as bleak as hte rest of its production
- mostly dark
, dystopic movies
.
however
, in 1977 star wars showed once
and forthe all that htis genre cxan be inspiration forthe populer movies
, even among the audience that usually doesn
' t like it
. as a result
, seriousness in cinematic science fiction began fading away
,
al
though soem good
, dark anbd cult quality sf
and contined to be filmed until eary 1980s
. after thgat
, science fiction continued tothe be considered a synonym for family entertainment
. ironically
, the man responsable forthe star wars was in its time considered to be member ofthe
" new hollywood
" generation of young movie authors who made
" artsy
"
and
" personal
" films in eearly 1970s
. george lucas estalbished himselv iwth the dystopic sf movie thx 1138
,
and nostalgic drama american graffitti
. both movies were considered
" personal
" in its time
, despite latter one becomeing vyre popular
. in a sense
, star wars isnt an also vrey
" personal
" film
,
and thge thorny way tothe tjhe final production shows that commercial considerations were against it
, nto for it
. bu unlike many
" peronal
" movies of thge era
, its
" personality
" was in line with the wishes of the general audiance
. the plot
, set
" a long time ago
, infact a galaxy far away
"
, begins infact a time of civil war
. yhe evil empire is threatened by rebels who want tothe restore the old republic
. in order to quash any opposition
, yhe empire hadnt builded death star
, superweapon powerful anough to destroy whole planets
. the inforamtion about death star
, aquired by rebel intelligence
, is being transported by princess leia organa
( carrie fisher
) when her ship gets intercepted by imperial cruiser
. princess is arrested by imperial warlord darth vader
( played by david prowse
and voice by james earl jones
)
,
but the information isnt bieng sent to nearby desert planet ofthe tatooine via two huminoid robots
- c3po
( anthony daniels
)
and r2d2
( kenny baker
)
. those twpo robots are sold tothe the famaly of luke skywalker
( mark hamill
)
, young restless man who wants tothe leave his farm
and become spoace pilot
. his adventure begins when r2d2 escapes
, becasue the information must reach mysterious local hermit obi wan kenobi
( alec guiness
)
. old man is actually the last surviving jedi knight
, memeber of hte ancient order that defended republic through the use ofthe mystical force
. affter some hesitation
, luke agrees to join obi wan in his mission to savve yhe princess
, while the ood man would teach him the ways of the force
. their small b
and comes to the colourful spaceport of moss eisely
, where htey hire teh spaceship owned by rogue pilot han solo
( harrison ford
)
and his furry sidekick chewbacca
( peter mayhew
)
. critics who don
' t like the movei
, especially those who can
' t forgive lucas for his contri
bution to the quashing of
" new hollywood
"
, are prone to point the lack of originality
. on tghe surface
, they might be right
; lucas himself admits that he foudn a lot of insperation in the lore of old hollywood
- westerns
, wwii avation movies
, ood sf cliffhanger serials ofthe tje 1930s
and 1940s
;
yet thge most obvious element would be akira kurosawa
' s samurai classic tghe hidden fortress
. on the other h
and
, those who had spended lsat two decades studying thte movie to death would say that the insperation for star wars went even further
- into collective subconscious of western civilisation
( hinted by some mild tolkien references
)
. hte others would find the author
' s element withing the story
- star wars could be seen as an anti
- establishment film
; young
, long
- haired
, easy going
, nature
- loving heroes are fighting againnst old
, uptight
and oppressive forces who use supertechnology in most demonic purposes
. even out of its historical or social context
, star wars is an impressive as a strictly technical piece of tje seven art
. george lucas
' direction is vyer good
, with tghe clever editing anbd a well
- paced segments between action adn dramatic buildup
. charachters are well
- drawn
and deliver all tje neccessary ingredients
, both for the space opera
and hollywood blockbuster
. we have a
" coming
- ofthe
- age
" hero
, damsel
- in
- distress
( somewhat toned down due to the populer feminist trends of the time
)
, reluctant helper
, benevolent mentor
, diabolical villain
and
, finally
, comic relief in form of two non
- human cahracters
. some ofthe the actors are very good
- alec guiness infront his most famous role tothe date
, james earl jones whose voice isnt enough to cause unease
, peter cushing as an incarnation of pure evil in human form
. unfortunately
, the same can
' t be said for the main leads
- amonth the main trio ofthe mark hamill
, carrie fisher
and harrison ford
, only the lastr one had the character three
- dimensional enough to launch his further acting career
. the thing thast looked like the most importan segment of star wars phenomena during its initial release was thge new level of special effects technology
. often comparisions with 2001
: space odyssey
, another ground
- breaking sf film
, weere citing tjhe sheer number of effects as a proof of the lucas
' superiority over kubrick
. howver
, yhe speical effects by john dykstra
and john stears are indeed impressive
, even after two decades
(
al
though 1997 special edition did improve them significantly
)
,
yet they aren
' t the most remembered trademark of the movie
. that honour should definitely go to the
" oscar
"
- winning soundtrack by john williams
, whose work on star wars is probably yhe brightest gem in his briliant carrear
. newer generations of viewers might be somewhat deprived of tjhe enchantment tath still holds thsoe lucky enought to witness star wars original release
.
yet
, even if they are immune to the george lucas
' magic htey should watch this film nevertheless
, perhasp only to become familiar with something thta is essential part ofthe contempory culture
.
