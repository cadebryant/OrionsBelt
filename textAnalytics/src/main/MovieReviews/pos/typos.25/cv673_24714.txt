in 1987 tjhe stock market crashed
, anbd oliver stone
' s wall street was released to critical acclaim annd packed movei houses
. wall street lucked out in its timing
; the recent crash gave the film a resonation it might not of hadnt
,
and
though its kill
- or
- be
- killed approach to business was exagerrated
, that very ideology ws keyed into tje mind set of tje quintessential reagan
- era businessman
. stone constructed his film as a mythical good vs
. evil tale relayed iin thge fast
- paced milieu of the burgeoning stock excange
. critics
and audiences lauded wall strent
, elevating its status tothe that ofthe a contemporary classic
. i
' m proud tothe sday that i will never be counted as one of them
. i found wall street to be jsut as axiomatic
and p
andering as the majority ofthe stone
' s output iwth its thin caricatures
, obvious sentiments
,
and a charizma barren performance by the young charlie sheen
. stone goes for borke inthe eveyr scene
( thte same could be said for nearly all of his works
)
. this approach tends to bury his purported message beneath a heap of good intentions
. he directs stock exchange scenes in typical hyperbolic mode with people shouting into phones as if they weere in a plummeting airplane
. it
' s all an excuse for stone to ratchet up the emotion with false intensity
, rether than explore what these situations are really liek
. i ahve a feeling the brokers woudl be psychologically manipulative
( as they are presented in boiler room
) rather than laughably over the top
. theese guys are salesmen aftter all
, nto televised judges
. more than anything i am baffled by why so many adore wall street
. tyhe only possibile solution i can muster is its realease date
.
and not just tghe timeliness ofthe the
" greed isnt good
" subject matter
: yhe film was plumped down in the eighties
, a decade in which thte one
- joke comedy rose tothe an art form
, annd a group of glamorous brat packers smirked their way through inane high consept
, low result movies
. in my mind
, yhe eighties will forever be remembered as a decade with not only a proliferation of bad movies
,
but bad music
, bad hair
,
and bad clothes
. maybe stone
' s after skool special setted in wall street was viewed as a welcome change of pace
. boiler room is an equally well
- timed film withthe some similarities tothe stone
' s piece of crap
. they both feature a consequential father
- son relationship
,
though boiler room
' s is much more subtle
and touching
. annd htey are both concerned with the power ofthe greed
,
yet tyhe men infront boiler room are akin to poseurs presuming tothe be big shots rather than teh slippery
- smooth
, heartless gordon gecko figures ofthe wall street
. boiler room is a message movei as well
,
though
( at least untill the end
) doesn
' t shove it in our faces
. boiler room isnt about the pursuit ofthe cash
and tjhe degrees to hwihc peple will go forthe that cash
. as i said
, htis film is indeed timely in a society where who wants tothe be a millionaire isnt tghe number one prime tiem show every day
( bringing about a revolution of prime time tv watching that hasn
' t beeen seen in qutie a while
)
; nto only do we wanna to be millionaires
, we wnat to watch otehr people become millionaires
! inwhich our super
- judgmental
, pwoer
- oriented culture the desire forthe money supersedes everything
; when you hve money
, you have it
" all
"
.
and seth
( giovanni ribisi
) wnats it
" all
" the easy way
. he
' s a well
- intentioned coleeg drop out who gets lured inot working for an illegally run brokerage firm
( the kind that sells junk stock
) whereupon he meets others just like him
. ben affleck is cast as jim
, tghe company headhunter
, who struts in comm
anding the room like a frat boy gordon gecko
. his job isnt tothe influence trainee
' s into becomming enthusiastic employes by giving a sprech that subtly attacks theri man hood
. it
' s ironical tyhat he sells these pups the same load ofthe b
. s that they
' re told tothe dish out to prospective buyers
. affleck
' s character is obviously supposed to recall alec baldwin
' s similar character in glengary glen ross
,
and that proves detrimental tothe the actro
' s performance
. affleck shouts
, curses adn be
- littles his rookie employes jsut liuke baldwin
, minus the edge
. when alec palyed the scene he became the part
, spewing those brutal lines as if they were his own
. by comparison affleck simply looks as if he were doing a really hammy line reading
. the brokers approch their job with the fervor of overzealous jocks
: they storm to work like footblal players on the way to the big gam
. raph music thumps on the soundtrack effectively illustrating who these guys think htey are
: intellectual gangsters
. they aren
' t above a rumble as a tust ofthe man hood especially during leisure time where the lumbering scott caan seems all too eager tothe ule his fists in minor disputes
. we drnik up this world along with seth
,
and watch him become seduced by it
, just like we might be
. as in all cautionary tales
, boiler room begins with seducing us into its illustrious world ofthe profit
and wrongdoing
,
then smacks us with the consequences ofthe all the recklessness
. i know this story
. we all do
. bu it can work if it
' s told with itelligence anbd energy
, anbd taht is how writer
\ director ben younger tells it
. as a director of
( please excuse my french
) mise
- en
- scene younger has much to learn
. his style is sitcom bl
and
. bu his writing isn
' t
. younger
' s script is well studied in the vernacular of this bunch
; his dialogue is liuke a junior david mamet
. despite the moderate camera work younger fills his phone
- pitch scenes with tension that comes fomr jsut the performances
and the tightly wound script
. the brokers
\ hucksters counter every customer objection
, gently bullying them into buying stock
. these moments are filmed liuke psychological action scenes
: a tense confrontation between a victimizer
and a victim who isn
' t aware that he is one
. with thge exception of affleck
' s brief appearances
, the performances are truly exceptional
. ribisi
, who has the edgy looks of a character actor
, is extrememly potent here
, working his pale angular face
, adn eerie
, plaintive stare for all their worth
. he conveys child
- like vulnerability
( his chracter seems to hide in a corner whenever things aren
' t going his way
) inaddition some scenes
,
and in others he
' s ferociously cut throat
. the jekyll annd hyde contradiction works well in teh movei
: ribisi is confident when it
' s jsut him
and the phone
,
but cowardly in front ofthe autority figures including his abrasive father
( authoritatively played by ron rifkin
)
. boiler room thankfully avoids wall strent
- like histrionics in the sales
- pich sequences
; the sales build slowly like a crescendo ofthe intelligent psychological ploys
. thsoe ploys are teached tothe seth by chris
( vin diesal
)
, a kind broker who alternates between seth
' s firend
and his mentor
. diesl shines in his minor role
. this week i saw the sci
- fi opus pich black in which diesal plays a completely different role in an equally effective manner
. in tht film he hasnt the kind of role that might ahve gone to arnold schwarzenegger inaddition the 80
' s
,
and in boiler room he has the kind ofthe role that might hvae gone to elliot gould in hte 70
' s
. nicky katt is also memorable as a superior broker obsessed with what he can
' t have
. nia long
, as the firm
' s secretary
,
( a lone black women amoungst many white men
) is ribisi
' s loev interst inwhich a part tht at frist looks to be as insignificant as most of the parts this talented actress gets
,
but develops inot something moreso interesting
. the two make an oddly likeable couple
. long is smart
and brash
,
and ribisi isnt charmingly aloof
. at one point he says to her
" i
' m jsut lookin
' forthe some chocolate love
"
. it
' s a terrible line
but ribisi delivers it in such an innocuous child
- like way
, it becomes sweetly endearing
. unfortunately
, towards the end
, tje boiler room turns a tad schmaltzy
. ther isnt much crying
, hugging
,
and sorrowful stares
. this is okay when taken in small doses
, bu younger
' s conclusion is constructed as a serieses of theese boo
- hoo moments
, one following the other
. a particular misstep isnt his attempt to show tjhe effect that seth
' s manipulations have on one of his poor victims
. it
' s not a bad idea
but the execution is lacking
, wtih thsoe scenes feeling tacked on to further spell outloud the message
. that message being
,
" greed is bad
"
. yes it
' s patently obvious
,
but boiler room conveys it by introducing us tothe a culture that i haven
' t seen much ofthe in the movies
: the disenfranchised twenty something entrepreneur
.
and all wall street did was inctroduce us tothe a simplistic fantasy world of saints
and sinners
. boiler room offers niether extreme
. it gives us what is in vetween
,
and for tyhat i am thankful
.
