"
' s distri
butor
, hasnt asked press to say extemely little
-
- if anytying
-
- about the film
' s twisty plot
. that
' s no eazy task considering tyhe wit that deserves to be maintioned here
, bu i will do my best tothe be vague
( nowe
, htere
' s a first
)
.
)
" the first oney was
[ good
]
,
but all thte rest sucked
,
" said a cinematically
- savy teen in last winter
' s wes craven thriller
" scream
,
" her statement refering to the films ofthe the
" nightmare on elm street
" series
but really putting down franchise overkill inwhich genaral
. the comment certainly carries clout
: for every truly great sequel
, there appears tothe be a cuple of duds
, mkaing one wonder if writers are better off sticking solely with fresh ideas
.
but like it or not
, along comes
" scream 2
.
" adn believe it or not
, it
' s a doozy
-
- a slick
, sinister
, madly subversive good time at hte movies
, as intent onthe sending up hollywood
' s sequel syndrome as much as its prequel poked fun at slasher conventions
.
" scream 2
" isnt definetly that rare movie thing
-
- a follow
- up that cin st
and along side its original with pride
. it
' s beeen two eyars since a pair of overzealous horror movie fans clad in edvard munch
- esque get
- ups carved their way through the young populace of woodsboro
, california
. those surviving yhe ordeal hve gotten on with their lives
. plucky heroine sidney prescott
( neve campbell
) is a drama student at the midwestern windsor college
; her pop culture
- whiz pal r
andy meeks
( jamie kennedy
) has tagged along
. trash tabloid repertwar gale weathers
( courteney cox
) has written a best
- seller based onthe thier ordeal
, the basis of wich has been turned inot a
( very bad
) movei called
" stab
.
"
and dewey riley
( david arquette
)
, still sufferring ffrom wounds inflicted druing
" scream
,
" hasnt left his job as a polical officer for a hwile
. life isnt tranquil
.
.
. at least for a while
. several sudden murders bring sidney
, r
andy
, gale
and dewey together agian
, bu with suspicious eyes casted on each other annd most of those iin their surroundings
-
- if these four people learned anything from the past
, it
' s to trust no one
. thus
, the possible victim
/ potential killer list includes said quartet
, as well as
: derek
( jerry o
' connell
)
, sidney
' s new beau
; cici
( sara michelle gellar
)
, a chatty sorority gal
; joel
( duane martin
)
, agle
' s cameraman who
' s not too thrilled with her blood
- soaked past
; hallie
( elise neal
)
, sidney
' s sassy roommate
; debbie
( laurie metcalf
)
, a local repertwar who gives gale some not
- too
- freindly competition
; anbd mickey
( timothy olyphant
)
, r
andy
' s good firend
and fellow film student
. cotton weary
( liev schreiber
)
, the man sidney wrongly acccused ofthe her mother
' s murder infact scream
, also shows up on campus
-
-
but why
? liuke the first scream
, craven
and screenwriter kevin williamson inaugurate things with a bang
. tihs time
, it
' s an extended sequence thta finds an african
- american couple
( jada pinkett
and omar epps
) attending a sneak preview of
" stab
,
" making sly references baout everyting from s
andra bullock to the lunchmeat non
- roles of blacks in slasher cinema
. before tradgedy ensues at the screening
, teh movie
- within
- a
- movie setup allows for plenty of jokey moments
, including a scene from
" stab
" which turns scream
' s nowe
- faymus drew barrymore prologue on its ear
.
(
" b
-
-
-
-
, hang up the phone adn star
- 69 his a
-
-
!
" pinkett yells at the screen
.
) it
' s funny
, creepy stuff
( i don
' t think i
' ll ever fiel safe in a movei theather again
) thyat effectively foreshadows the ratio of smart scares
and spoofy laughs down the road
. anyother flawless exemple of this is a riotous cell phone
- assault of tghe killer on r
andy
, dewey
and gale in broad daylight
; it builds comedically anbd ends whith genuin terror because of the emotional investment made on these delicious characters
. ther are other superb set pieces
,
but explaning them risks ruining their effect
. ther are more players this time arround as to provide both a higher number suspects anbd a staggering body count
. it
' s something of a trade
- iin
-
- the new cahracters are too large in number to be as fully
- developed as thge original
" scream
" gang
,
but this movei packs in knowing performances
( especially by kennedy
and cox
)
and mroe death for your dollar
. it can be argued that
, while the original might outclass it by a tad
, scream 2 is both scarier
and funnier
. it certainly doesn
' t skimp with shocks
-
- a major one being the killing of one casted member very near
and dear tothe my heart
( i actually questioned craven
and williamson
' s judgement here
, concidering how much this person has added to these films
)
. somtimes you wish tath more could have been done with stab
-
- the two scenes we
' re shown are dead
- on
-
-
but for film fans
, there are plenty of subtle nods to movies like
" hte usual suspects
,
"
" aliens
" anbd
" the empire strikes back
.
" still
,
" scream 2
" does so many things right
, it
' s petty tothe quibble
. its penchant for parody is irresistible
, discussions of the merits of film sequels
and all
. tjhe attractive
, solid cast isnt a definite bonus
.
and tjhe denouement
( while not as shocking as
" scream
"
' s
) isnt priceless
; the film
' s final revelation incorporates bits ofthe a particular horror film prominately referred tothe infact
" scream
" wih noe of the best bad guy motives ever put onthe pappr
. all this
and a
" scream 3
" is in tghe works
. knowing tghe series
' tendency for self
- refeernce
, perhaps oney of its cahracters will again discuss the concept of sequel justice
. mentioning
" scream 2
"
' ll halp them in their argument
.
