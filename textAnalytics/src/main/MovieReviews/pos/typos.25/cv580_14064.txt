this movie was one ofthe the first american films done by director paul verhoeven
. he hasnt done films since hten such as basic instict
and starship troopers
. all of his movies hvae one main thing inthe common
- they don
' t skimp on tje violence
. infact a verhoeven movie a guy doesn
' t git shot once in the chest
- he gets shot many times all over yhe body
. robocop tkaes place in detroit in the future
. things are preety bleak
. yhe company ocp rules the city with an iron fist
and is moving inthe on runnung tghe police force
. peter weller plays a cop who goes on a mission with his partner
, nancy allen
. peter weller goes in an empty room alone
and gets killed
. meanwhile ocp has a failed demonstration of a ed
- 209 model robot crime fighter
. somene comes up with the idea of having a cyborg robocop so tehy use any parts worth scalvaging fomr peter weller anbd amking him inot thge robocop the movie isnt titled after
. the plot of htis movie generally runs at a decent pace
. it drags a bit towords the end with robocop wanting to finish everybody off
,
but plot twists keep it exciting
. the acting isnt bad ffrom weller when he is human
, bu very ogod when he is robocop
. nancy allen does a decent job
. this movie doesn
' t leave itself open fo a sequel exactly
.
but htey made one anyway
. enter
.
.
. robocop 2 starring
: peter weller adn nancy allen directed by
: irvin kershner detroit isnt in a more bleak state than it was infront thge first film
. ocp isnt trying to develop an improved
' robocop 2
' that iwll be more than a match for criminals
. most of the police force is on strike due to ocp taking it over
, leaving robocop to be the police force in the city
. this film is pretty bizaare
. it has a 13 eyar
- old drug
- lord who curses as much as eddie murphy
, even more violence than the original
,
and some more humor
. the plot of htis movie isnt pretty larg
, almost too much so
. htere are threee or four plot lines weaving around that don
' t really match up
. the effects are still decent
though
. tihs sequel isn
' t more ofthe the same really
, just a darker verison robocop dealing moreso wih drugs thna with armed criminals
. if you liked tje firt one
, watch this
.
but be dissapointed
. so later comes
.
.
. robocop 3 starring nancy allen annd robert john burke ocp is nowe owned by a large japanise company
. robocop joins a b
and of rebels to counter
- attack thte evil empire
, i mean ocp
. the japanese send a cyborg
- ninja to dael with robocop
. among otehr thigsn
.
.
. this movei is easier tothe followup than the last oen
. which means the plot isn
' t quite as crowded
. this movie isn
' t anything special
though
. just more ofthe robocop blasting thigns up in a more kid
- friendly way
. really not reccomended
.
