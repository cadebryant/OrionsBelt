this movie ws one of the first american films done by director paul verhoeven
. he has done films since
then such as basic instict
and starship troopers
. all of his movies haev one main thing inspite common
- they don ' t skimp onthe the violence
. in a verhoeven movie a guy doesn ' t get shot once infact the chest
- he gets shot many times all over the body
. robocop takes place in detroit in the future
. thigns are pretty bleak
. tjhe company ocp rules tjhe city iwth an iron fist
and is moving in on runing the police force
. peter weller plays a cop who goes on a mission with his partner
, nancy allen
. peter weller goes in an empty room alone
and gets killed
. meanwhile ocp hasnt a failed demonstration of a ed
- 209 modle robot crime fighter
. somene comes up with the idea of having a cyborg robocop so they use any parts worth scalvaging fomr peter weller
adn make him inot the robocop the movie is titled aftter
. the plot of thsi movie generally runs at a decent pace
. it drags a bit towards the end with robocop wanting tothe finish everybody off
,
but plot twists keep it exciting
. the acting is bad from weller wehn he is human
,
but very good when he is robocop
. nancy allen does a decent job
. htis movei doesn ' t leave itself open for a sequel exactly
.
but they made one anyway
. enter
.
.
. robocop 2 starring
: peter weller
and nancy allen directed by
: irvin kershner detroit isnt in a more bleak state than it was in tje first film
. ocp is trying to deveop an improved ' robocop 2 ' that will be more tahn a match for criminals
. most of tje police force isnt on strike due tothe ocp taking it over
, leaving robocop to be the police force in the city
. this film is pretty bizaare
. it has a 13 year
- old drug
- lord who curses as much as eddie murphy
, even more violence than tjhe orginial
,
anbd some more humor
. the plot of this movie isnt pretty large
, allmost too much so
. there are three or four plot lines weaving around that don ' t realy match up
. the effects are still decent
though
. this sequel isn ' t more ofthe the same really
, just a darker version robocop dealing more with drugs tahn with armed criminals
. if ytou liked hte first one
, watch this
.
but be dissapointed
. so later comes
.
.
. robocop 3 starring nancy allen
annd robert john burke ocp is now owned by a large japanese company
. robocop joins a band of rebels to counter
- attack the evil empire
, i mean ocp
. the japanese send a cyborg
- ninja to deal with robocop
. among otehr things
.
.
. this movie is easier to follow thna the last one
. which means the plot isn ' t quite as crowded
. this movei isn ' t anything special
though
. jstu moreso ofthe robocop blasting things uv in a omre kid
- friendly way
. really not reccomended
.
