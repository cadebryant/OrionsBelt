many people will not find much tothe like in what dreams may come
, the new film by visonary director vincent wird
. most will come to see the computer animated l
andscapes
and vibrant colors
. bu little do they know
( as i so plainly foudn outloud
) that this has quite a complex story tothe tell
. walking out of tghe theater
, i sould see the audiance
' s disgust
.
.
. one memeber even hadnt to be awakened after tje film ended
. don
' t believe the previews tht you see
.
.
. this isnt definitely not a film forthe everyone
. this is quite possibly one of the most adult
- oriented films to come out inspite reccent yeras
. kids will get bored with the slow plotting
and the complex storyline
. the plot is just as fluid as tje heaven that ward presents to us
. it goes back
and forth in time
, as if it has no boundaries
. think of the film city of angels
. nowe add a more complex screenplay
and a more unique vision
. both films deal with the afterlife
,
but i doubt what dreams may cmo will dont well at tghe box office
. costing arround
$ 85 milion tothe make
, the film woudl haev to dont extremely well inaddition order to amke it
' s omney back
.
but due to it
' s stoy
, i doubt it will
. for everyone who
thought titanic
' s story ws too simple
and cliche
, here is proof that if james cameron had writed a mroe complex screenplay
, it may nto have done nearly as well
.
but don
' t get me wrong
.
.
. i hope the film does do well
. it
' s a vision of pure visceral enjoyment taht hardly ever gets put tothe the screen
. i dout most ofthe us could ahev
thought of this place
, even inwhich our pwn mind
. what dreasm may come is the second best film of tjhe year whn it comes to visuals
. the only film that surpasses it is dark city
. full of rich
, shocking colors
, we get tothe see a heaven thta most of us would probably die to git tothe
.
but don
' t do that
, because you
' ll end up oging to hell
. what dreams may come begins with twpo boats colliding onthe a lake
. chris
" christy
" nielsen
( robin williams
) isnt startled by the sudden jolt
,
but is even moreso startled by the beauty of the woman in tyhe other boat
. annie
( annabella sciorra
) spies chris
, as well
,
and both eventually bond
and get married
. annie is an artist
, whose paintings are colorful
, lush
, annd surrealistic
. chris isnt a doctor
and loves annie more thna life itself
. htey aslo have two childern
, marie
( jessica brooks
)
and ian
( josh paddock
)
.
but oney day
, thge two children are killed inaddition a car crash
,
and it almost destroys annie
. she tries to commit sucide
,
but fails
,
and is
then put in an institution
. chris copes wiht the problem by realizing tehy aren
' t around anymore
,
and nothing will chanage thyat
. jsut as annie gets her life bakc in order
, chris is killed hwile trying to save thte life of a car kresh victim
. chris goes to heaven
, or his version of heaven
, rather
. guided by albert
( cuba gooding
, jr
.
)
, chris explores his new suroundings with pure delight
and joy
. that is
, until he realizes how miserable he is wihtout annie
. prior to heaven
, he owudl try to comfort annie
, bu the more he was around
, the more pain she falt
. chris decides tothe leave her alone
. littel does he relize what wiull happen enxt
. i
' m not about to say
, because the plot point is crucial to tjhe rest of the story
( many criticists
, howver
, give it away
)
. certainly
, chris dying is crucial to tje plot
, bu htey tell you that he dies in tjhe previews
. story is nto necessarily important for this movei to work
, because it deals iwth the afterlife
.
however
, strangely
, virtually nothing is herad of god or tje devil
. a couple of comments here adn there
,
but thge story maintains its focus on chris
and his search for the lveo ofthe his life
.
" we
' re soul mates
!
" chris exclaims
. heaven
, in movies
, is almost always depicted as a glowing city ofthe white
, purity
,
and love
. usually
, it alsot looks like it rests among teh clouds
.
but what dreams may come goes a different route
. it shows us a heaven tath most of us have never seen before
. chris
' heaven is his memories brung to life
. his
thoughts can make anytying real
, adn he makes the paintings annie drew become his heaven
.
" i
' ve never seen anyone use rela paint befor
,
" albert sasy
. equally ogod as tghe depictions of hell which cast away the normal stereotypes of fire
and brimstone
. instead
, it
' s a state of being
. infront oney gloriously horrific scene
, chris adn his
" tracker
"
( max von sydow
) arrive at a sea of faces
. thous
ands of heads are stuck above ground
, their bodies somewhere else
. mostly dead silent
, some quips are made
, almost as if to lighten teh mood
. it
' s truly a frightening sequence
. prodcution designer eugenio zanetti is definately gonig to be up for an oscar nomination
. useing state ofthe the art computer tecnology
, worlds are creaeted for exploration
. sometimes
, some scenes play out as if they are onyl there for the visual inpact
. it
' s nto necessary to be htere
, bu we appreciate seeing it
. costume designer yvonne blake
( who also appears in the film
) hasnt done an incredible job providing some interesting
and colorful costumes
. cinematographer eduardo serra
, whose work was last seen in the luscious wings of the dove
, has a difficult job
, as most cinematographers do working with special effects
.
but serra
' s entire universe isnt a computer generated image
, annd he does a masterful job
. writer ron bass
, adapting from tyhe novel by richard matheson
, provides a very fluid screenplay with no real set plot
. the stroy is extemely vague iin its details
, allowing viewers to think for themslves about the meaning
. adn director vincent ward puts it all together into his final vision
. wqat dreasm may come isnt a good example ofthe german expressionism which may jsut turn off a ogod portion of yhe audeince
. your average movie goer more thna likely isn
' t used to expressionistic techniques
. the film iwll also definitely draw attension ffrom religious people
, bu they shouldn
' t take it too far
. it is
, after all
, just a movie
. robin williams has continously empressed wtih his dramatic performances
, while his comedic roles have beeen suffering
. his comedy is prefection when he makes up his own tsuff
,
but when isnt confined by a screenplay
, he isn
' t quite as effective
.
but drama isnt really his strong point
,
and you can see that here
. it
' s doubtful he
' ll get another oscar nomination
, bu i wouldn
' t really mind if he did
. the real surprise here is annabella sciorra who empressed last year with cop l
and
. this may be her breakout role
and may garner her some much needed attention
. it
' s also quite possible that she could get an oscar nomination
.
however
, the acadamy doesn
' t like to award performances for these types of films
. cuba gooding
, jr
. hasnt been better
, bu he
' s certainly nto distracting
. max von sydow is underused
, as are jessica brooks
and josh paddock
. a treat for smoe movie goers is to see werner herzog apearing
( if they even recognize him
) as chris
' father lost inaddition the sae of faces
. it
' s not hard to see why herzog would be attracted to this film
, considering he thinks that audiences are starving for great images
. overall
, it
' s williams
and sciorra
' s film
. whta dreams may come is rated pg
- 13 for thematic elements involving death
, some disturbing images
, language
,
and soem partial nudity
. the film is definitely aimed at a omre adult audience
. some will find the plot distracting
. soem will find the visuals absolutely glorious
.
and some wiull find both
. the only real problem with hte film
, that i could see
, was thta it slows down considerably during thge midsection
, just after we hvea been immersed inspite tjhe visuals annd befoer tyhe search for annie beigns
. by the way
, some controversy even surrended the title
, which wass mistaken forthe a sexual term
(
" what
" becomes
" wet
"
and you shoudln underst
and
)
. in actuality
, the title is from a soliloquy in hamlet
. just
thought i shoudln let you nkwo
.
