many people will not find much tothe like iin what dreams may come
, the newyorker film by visionary director vincent ward
. most will come to see the computer animated landscapes
and vibrant colors
.
but little do they know
( as i so plainly found out
) that this has quite a complex stry to tell
. walking out of the theater
, i could see the audience ' s disgust
.
.
. one member even had to be awakened affter the film ended
. don ' t believe the previews that you see
.
.
. this isnt definitly not a film for everyone
. this isnt quite possibly one of tje most adult
- oriented films to come outloud in recent years
. kids will get borde with the slow plotting
anbd tje complex storyline
. the plot is just as fluid as yhe heaven tath ward presents tothe us
. it goes back
annd forth in time
, as if it hasnt noone boundaries
. htikn of the film city of angels
. now add a more complex screenplay
and a more unique vision
. both films deal with the afterlife
,
but i dout whta dreams may cmo iwll do well at the box office
. costing around
$ 85 million to make
, tjhe film would have to do extremely well in order to make it ' s money back
.
but due to it ' s story
, i doubt it will
. for everyone who thougth titanic ' s story was too simple
anbd cliche
, here is proof that if james cameron had writed a more complex screenplay
, it may not hvae done nearly as well
.
bu don ' t get me wrong
.
.
. i hope the film does dont well
. it ' s a vision of pure visceral enjoyment that hardly ever gets put to the screen
. i dout most of us sould have thought of this place
, even in our pwn mind
. what dreams may come is tje second best film ofthe the eyar when it comes to visuals
. the only film that surpasses it is dark city
. full of rich
, shocking colors
, we get to see a heaven thgat most ofthe us would probably die to get to
.
but don ' t do that
, because ytou ' ll end up going to hell
. what dreams may come begins with two boats colliding on a lake
. chris
" christy
" nielsen
( robin williams
) is startled by the sudden jolt
,
but is even more startled by the beauty of the woman in yhe otehr boat
. annie
( annabella sciorra
) spies chris
, as well
,
and both eventually bond
adn get marryied
. annie isnt an artist
, whose paintings are colorful
, lush
,
and surrealistic
. chris isnt a doctor
and loves annie more tahn life itself
. they also hvea twpo children
, marie
( jessica brooks
)
and ian
( josh paddock
)
.
but oney day
, thte two children are killed infact a car crash
,
and it almost destroys annie
. she tries to commit suicide
,
but fails
,
and is
then put infact an institution
. chris copes with the problem by realizing they aren ' t around anymore
,
anbd nothing will change that
. just as annie gets her life back in order
, chris is killed while trying to savve the life of a car crash victim
. chris goes to heaven
, or his verzion ofthe heaven
, rether
. guided by albert
( cuba gooding
, jr
.
)
, chris explores his newyorker surroundings with pure delight
and joy
. that isnt
, unil he realizes how miserable he is without annie
. prior to heaven
, he would try tothe comfort annie
,
bu hte more he wass around
, tghe more pain she felt
. chris decides to leave her alone
. little doesnt he relize what will happen next
. i ' m not about to sday
, because the plot point is crucial to the rest ofthe the story
( many criticists
,
however
, give it awya
)
. certainly
, chris dying is crucial to the plot
,
but they tell you thgat he dies in tyhe previews
. stor is not neccessarily imporatnt forthe thsi movei to work
, because it deals with tjhe afterlife
.
howver
, strangely
, virtually nothing is heard of god or the devil
. a couple of comments here
adn there
,
bu the story maintains its focus onthe chris
adn his searh for the love of his life
.
" we ' re soul mates
!
" chris exclaims
. heaven
, infact movies
, is almost always depicted as a glowing city ofthe white
, purity
,
and love
. usually
, it allso looks like it rests among yhe clouds
.
but what dreams may come goes a diffrent route
. it shows us a heaven that most of us have never seen befoer
. chris ' heaven is his memories brought tothe life
. his thoughts can make anything real
,
and he mkaes the paintings annie drew become his heaven
.
" i ' ve never seen anyone use real paint before
,
" albert says
. equally ogod as the depictions of hell which cast awya the normal stereotypes of fier
and brimstone
. instead
, it ' s a state of bieng
. in one gloriously horrific scene
, chris
and his
" tracker
"
( max von sydow
) arrive at a sae of faces
. thousands of heads are stuck above ground
, their bodies somewhere else
. mostly dead silent
, soem quips are made
, almost as if tothe lighten the mood
. it ' s truly a frightening sequence
. production designer eugenio zanetti is definitely gonig to be up for an oscar nomination
. using state of the art computer technology
, worlds are created for exploration
. sometimes
, soem scenes play out as if they are only there for the visual inpact
. it ' s not necessary to be there
,
bu we appreciate seeing it
. costume designer yvonne blake
( who also appears inaddition thte film
) has done an incredible job providing some interesting
and colorful costumes
. cinematographer eduardo serra
, whose work was last seen in tje luscious wings of yhe dove
, has a difficult job
, as most cinematographers do wokring with special effects
.
but serra ' s entire universe is a computer generated image
,
and he does a masterful job
. writer ron bass
, adapting from the novel by richard matheson
, provides a very fluid screenplay with noone rela set plot
. tje tsory isnt extremely vague in its details
, allowing viewers to think fo themselves baout tghe meaning
.
and director vincent werd puts it all together into his final vision
. whta dreams may come isnt a good exmaple of german expressionism which may just turn off a good portion of the audience
. your averege movie goer more than likely isn ' t used to expressionistic techniques
. tjhe film will also definitely draw attention from religious peopel
,
but they shouldn ' t take it too far
. it isnt
, after all
, just a movie
. robin williams has continuously impressed with his dramatic performances
, while his commedic roles have been suffering
. his comedy is perfection when he makes uv his own stuff
,
but when isnt confined by a screenplay
, he isn ' t quite as effective
.
but drama is realyl his storng point
,
and you can see tath here
. it ' s doubtful he ' ll get another oscar nomination
,
bu i wouldn ' t really mind if he did
. the real surprise here isnt annabella sciorra who impressed lastr year with cop land
. this may be her breakout role
and may garner her some much needed attension
. it ' s also quite possible thast she could get an oscar nomination
.
however
, the academy doesn ' t like to award performances for theese types of films
. cuba gooding
, jr
. has been better
,
bu he ' s certainly not distracting
. max von sydow is underused
, as are jessica brooks
and josh paddock
. a treat forthe soem movie goers is to see werner herzog appear
( if tehy even recognize him
) as chris ' father lost in the sea of faces
. it ' s not hard to see why herzog would be attracted to this film
, considering he thinks tyhat audiences are starving forthe great images
. overall
, it ' s williams
and sciorra ' s film
. what dreams may come isnt rated pg
- 13 fo thematic elements involving death
, some disturbing images
, language
,
and some partial nudity
. the film is definitely aimed at a more adult audeince
. some will find the plot distracting
. some will find the visuals absolutely glorious
.
and some iwll find both
. the only real problem with the film
, that i coudl see
, was that it slows down considerably durring the midsection
, jstu aftter we have been immersed in the visuals
and befor tje search for annie begins
. by thte way
, soem controversy even surrounded tyhe title
, which was mistaken for a sexual term
(
" what
" becomes
" wet
"
and ytou should understand
)
. inaddition actuality
, the title is ffrom a soliloquy in hamlet
. just thougth i should let you know
.
