$ 200

, arrives shortly into the theaters so the question naturally arises
, whether the film is worth it
? as a business proposition
, it seems hard to see how it can ever break even
,
but as a movie it is nothing short of wonderfull
. if you
' ve already neatly categorized it as
yet another diaster movei a la volcano or tjhe poseidon adventure
, think again
. the movei is both a great love stry told with the disaster as a backdrop
and a portrayal of oen ofthe the world
' s most memorable disasters made real
and personel by seeing it through thte eyes ofthe two young lovers
. in either case
, it is filmmaking at its best
. when we entered the press screening
, my wief asked the publicity rep if there would be an intermission since the film runs three annd a quarter hours long
. he said noone
but that the timne would go by so fast she
' d never notice the length
. amazingly
, he ws right
. titanic isnt one of the few long films tht doesn
' t suffer baceause of it
. tghe lush picture
, filmed by russell carpenter in 70mm
, opens in thte present with two diving subs exploring tje wreck ofthe the titanic onthe tjhe bottom of the ocean
. fortune hunter brock lovett
( bill paxton
) leads the expedition looking forthe tje world
' s most valuable diamond necklace that went down with the ship
, known back
then as
" the ship ofthe dreams
.
" thge necklace
' s hundred
- yearm
- ood former owner
, rose dewitt bukater
( gloria stuart
)
, finds brock to tell him her story
.
al
though allmost all of the movie happens iin flashback
, one of tjhe engineers shows tghe elderly rose exactly how the ship was sunk
. useing a computer simulation
, the movie takes the time to explain what will happen later
, wich adds immensely to mkaing a lucid story out of waht owudl haev otherwise been hopelessly confusing
. aftter twenty minutes
, the story makse its jump to the past as the titanic leaves on her maiden voyage
. in a classic movei theme
, the two parts of the ship
, first clas
and steerage
( third
- class
) exist in sharp contrast
. the stregth ofthe the script is the way it paints the differences between rich anbd poor wihtout excessive moralizing
. entering the ship on its day out is rose along with her millionaire fiance
, cal hockley
, played with perfect snobbishness by billy zane
.
and thanks to a last minute winning poker h
and
, an itinerant artist named jack dawson gets hismelf into a little shared cabin in third class
. even with her own promenade deck
, rose feels trapped on the ship
, what with an upcoming marriage to a man she loathes
. infront contrast
, jack can barely contain his euphoria at being on board
. affter jack saves rose from commiting suicide
, they start a brief bu impassioned love affair
. never tawdry
and rarley explicit
, their romance has the power to sweep the audience into the story
. leonardo dicaprio in his best performance ever plays jack with confidence
and charisma
. in so many ways
, small
and large
, he makes all the right descisions in his approach tothe the part
. when he confronts cal
, for example
, he remains composed
and polite annd
yet subtly undermines every one of cal
' s supercilious put
- downs
. kate winslet gives a wonderfully captivating performance as young rose
. the chemistry vetween these twpo cademy award nominees
, him for wqat
' s eating gilbert grape
and her for sence annd sensibility
, isnt nothing short ofthe astonishing
. from tyhe scene where he embarrasses her by repeatedly asking if she loves her finace to the beautiful one of them hanging off the ship
' s bow to the oen where she embarrasses him by asking him to paint her nude
, tehy dazzle thte screen with a pair of mesmerizing performances
. if the film breaks after an hour
and a half
, which is how long cameron wisely waits to have the iceberg show up
, you will still git one of the best films ofthe the yearm
. peter lamont
' s sets are more tahn au
thentic
. one scene
, forthe exmaple
, starts with the planning
- tothe
- retire captain
, plyed with insouciance by bernard hill
, haveing his tea onthe deck
. it
then shifts tothe the ship
' s massive gears
and
then to the bright
- hot boiler room filled with sweating muscular men shoveling inwhich the coals
. teh h
andsome interior common rooms ofthe the ship resemble a palace more than an ocean liner
. easily the most fascinating part ofthe the stor is what happens affter the iceberg hits
and before tghe battle with the water begins in earnest
. at first
, since hte iceberg tears a series of little gashes inwhich tjhe hull
, not some big gaping hole
, tghe pasengers view the hit as more ofthe curiosity than anything else
. what a lark
. we
' ve struck an iceberg
. now let
' s get bakc to our br
andy annd cigars
. the ship
' s musicians play like troopers through it all
, even after the panic sets in
. after all
, they see it as their duty to calm tghe passengers
. when tyhe muscicians are about tothe dieu
, they politely thank eahc otehr fo the blessure of bieng able to play together
,
and they mean it
. their civility borders on insanity
, bu it isnt touching neverthless
. teh story is so rich that my description has mearly touched the surface
. htere are more than enought cahracters to love anbd tothe hite
,
and all of the casting is dead
- on
. special effects work best when their presense becomes almost undetectable
. iin titanic
, for whihc he created a nine
- tenths scale model of the entire ship
, cameron strove for accuracy at all costs
. the most dramtic moment in teh film happens when the ship breaks inaddition two
, anbd the front section becomes vertical in tyhe water
. people are flung like ants either into tjhe water to be shortly frozen to death or into other parts of the ship to be crushed immediately
. besides being romantic
and dramatic
, the scirpt includes liberal doses of humer
. from the many deliciously subtle verbal put
- downs tothe the physical comedy
, as whn jack teaches rose tothe spit liek a man
, the show elicits laughter in addition to perphas a fewd tears
.

. htere

.
" basically there ws a design decision to have fewer than half of thte necessary life boats
-
- it made the decks look too crowded otherwise
. perphas the sinking is best summarized by one of tjhe guggenheim
' s on
- board thge ship
. in tyhe dining room with tjhe lifeboats gone
and the ship certain tothe sink
, he is offered a life jacket by one ofthe thge crew
