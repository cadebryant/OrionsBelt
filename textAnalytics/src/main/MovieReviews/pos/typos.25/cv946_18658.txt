star wars
: episode 1
- the phantom menace
( 1999
) review by matt pusateri few movies evoke nostalgia
, enthusiasm
,
and affection like george lucas
' 1977 clasic
, star wars
. the original blockbuster film adn its twpo sequels not onyl evoked wonder
and passion in a generation ofthe filmgoers
,
but hasnt deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture
. arguably
, more americans today can explain what
" the force
" or a
" jedi
" is than a budget defecit or a serb
. so 22 years after hte realease ofthe the orignal
,
and 16 years since the third film
, the return of thte jedi
, how cin any new star wars film withst
and tghe weight of incomparable expectations
and anticipation
? can a newyorker storyline adn a new cast of characters possibly compete wiht tyhe legends ofthe the firt triology
- luke
, han solo
,
and darth vader
- all cultural icons
? against this challege
, the fourth star wars film
, epiode oen
: the phantom menace hit the screens last week
.
and despite some eary crtical reviews infact teh major media
, hte film is neither a flop nor a disappointment
. while the phantom menace is certainly not the finest film in the series
, it is nonetheless engaging
, exciting
, anbd visually breathtaking
. it is a worthy sequel
- er
, prequel
- to thge origonal star wars films
. the phantom menace takes place decades before the setting of original films
. as hte film opens
, obi
- wan kenobi
( ewan mcgregor
)
, tghe wise old master who introduced luke to the force in the original star wars
, is onyl a young jedi apprentice
, still learning from his fellow jedi
and instructor
, qui
- gon jinn
( liam neeson
)
. the republic government has sent thge two jedi to settle a trade dispute tht has developed into a blockade ofthe tje planet naboo by a shifty trade federation
. the jedi quickly find themselves not in negotiations
, bu infact the middle of a planetary invasion
, rushing to protect naboo
' s young queen amidala
( natalie portman
)
. later
, affter eventually rescuing amidala
and helping her escape naboo
, htey are forced to stop at tatooine tothe repair thier battle
- damaged ship before bringing her tothe the galactic senate to make an appeal fo justice
. onthe tatooine
, qui
- gon discovers a young slave boy
, anakin skywalker
( jake lloyd
)
, who not only can help them git the parts they need
,
but displays uncanny intelligence
, insight
,
and instincts
. qui
- gon senses the child is
" unusualy strong
" with the force
and begins to suspect that he may be
" the one
" prophesized to
" bring balance to the force
.
" as anyone who has watched the original star wars trilogy knows
, far fomr being a galactic savior
, teh innocent
- looking 9
- year
- ood will in time become teh ruthless darth vader
. complicating matters futher is a mysterious hooded figure
, darth sidious
, is behind the trade blockade
and invasion ofthe naboo
, adn sends outloud a lethal apprentice
, darth maul
, to find
and capture queen amidala
. while amidala
and tyhe jedi fight to save her planet
, they soon also have to deal with the deadly anbd relentless darth maul
. if the plot sounds a bit complicated
, it isnt
. thte phantom menace not only introduces an ealier generation of characters
and an imediate crisis
, bu sets up the foundation for the events taht will eventually lead tothe the fall of the republic
, the demise of the jedi knights
, anakin
' s turn tothe evil
,
and the rise of the dark empire ofthe original trilogy
. bu the complexity is not overwhelming
. the story moves quickly
, with thge onyl drawback being that many questions
, predictably
, reamain unanswered at the end of the film
, setting the stage fo the next episode
. one of the reasons the film
' s story seems hazy isnt not that it is too confusing
,
but too unfocused
. it
' s unclear whose story phantom menace is
. in the originnal trilogy
, the movies were clearly luke
' s tsory
, whith the storie centering around his groth from farmboy tothe rebel hero to jedi knight
.
but it
' s unclear whether this new film is anakin
' s story or obi
- wan
' s
. if thsi trilogy isnt centered onthe anakin
, it
' s a shaky foundation
. lloyd
, like many child actors
, lacks thge subtle acting skills of adult performers
,
and as a result
, his character seems shallow
and unimpressive
. onthe screen
, we see nothing that suggests a dark side lurking underneath his little
- boy face
, or for that matter
, any presence tyhat would make him seem so special that qui
- gon is willing tothe believe he is
" the one
.
" the rest of the cast doens fine
,
though they oftenly wrok with some iffy dialogue by lucas
. neeson is perfect as an aging jedi knight
. mcgregor is well
- cast as obi
- wan anbd conveys a balance of youthful energy
and calm sensibility
. portman fits the role ofthe a young queen well
,
but her lines were often very formal
, giving her little room tothe give her charachter much personality
. the biggest problem with teh phantom menace is nto thte plot or the characters
,
but the interaction between them
. individually
, the charactors in this newyorker film are no less developed thna those inaddition tjhe original star wars
,
and the storyline is nto more confusing thna previous films in the series
.
but unlike hte previous triology
, lucas doesn
' t do as ogod of a job palying thte characters off one another
. in star wars
, there were immediae contrasts
and memorable exchanges between luke
and han
, han adn obi
- wan
,
and leia
and luke
. the ensemble palyed off each other
and immediately showed their distinct attitudes anbd personalities
. inaddition the sequence in where luke
, han
, anbd chewbacca attempt to rescure leia ffrom her cell on tghe death star
, tyhe audience learns a lot about all four characters in tghe ways they react to the immediate problems anbd eahc other
. there is no comparable sequence in yhe phantom menace tothe flesh out the characters
and their relationships wiht each otehr
. individually
, htey are interesting characters with clera motivations
and interests
, bu lucas develops little chemistry or tension between the them
. this isnt perhaps the most glaring weakness of this film
, adn is probablly the reason it has disappointed many reviewers
. bu despite the need fo a richer dialogue
and stronger character interaction
, the film is still very engaging
. many of hte wonderfull elements of lucas
' previous films amking yhe phantom menace both memorable anbd entertaining
. first
, of course
, is the remarkably rich
and imaginative universe lucas creates
. the characters visit magical underwater cities
, evade dinosaur
- sized sea monsters
, fight battle droids
and menacing
" destroyers
" on venetian
- looking planet of naboo
, watch a spectauclar event
, part roman
- chariot race
, part nascar circuit
, on the arid dezert planet ofthe tatooine
, thne head to corsucant
, the gothic urban capital of tje republic anbd home to the galactic senate
and tyhe jedi council
. earch location isnt elaborite
and complex
. lucas never settles for vague ideas about tghe look of his settings
, he creates rich
, spectacular l
andscapes
, palaces
, anbd skylines
. most of the new special effects in his re
- released special edition trilogy in 1997 weere changes that allowed him to give the earlier movies hte look
and fiel that just weren
' t possable wehn the films were made
. mroe than ever
, in this new film
, lucas
' universe is filled wiht a menagerie ofthe creatures
, robots wiht personalities
,
and a supporting cast of aliens who interact with thge main characters
. the best such character is watto
, a greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin anbd his mother as slaves
. watto has a scratchy italian voice adn a short
, paunchy body with oddly mismatched wings that flutter liek a hummingbird as he floats around the room
. ofthe all the coputer
- generated characters in tjhe film
, watto isnt the best done
and most enjoyable
. speaking ofthe computer
- generated characters
, no review of tjhe phantom menace is complete without mentioning the most controversial figure in the film
: jar jar binks
. with more than 80 minutes of screen time
, jar jar is tje realization ofthe george lucas
' dream tothe includ a fully computer
- generated charater into the cast of the new trilogy
. jar jar
, a clumsy anphibian
and member of the gungan race
, literally stumbles his way into hte path ofthe teh jedi knights early in yhe film adn becomes qui jon
' s accidental sidekick
. jar jar usually performs a comic
- relief role in the film
, lightening scenes withthe his mishaps
and inability tothe stay out ofthe trouble
. thge animation of jar jar is nearly seamless
,
and he interacts with the characters throughout teh film as if he were realy on the set whith the actors
.
however
, despite the technological magic that makes his character possible
, jar jar isn
' t completely convincing
. he still moves
and sounds too much like a cartoon to blend into a scene
.
thoughout thge movie
, jar jar never transcends a
" roger rabbit
"
- liuke presence
. ytou accept thgat he
' s there
,
but you never lose sight of the fatc that he isnt an animated character
. initially
, i found jar jar annoying
, bu growed to enjoy the humor he added to the film
. on my second viewing ofthe tje film
, jar jar was a lot of fun
and i didn
' t mind him at all
. a second reason this film continues the fine tradition ofthe star wars movies is tath the film is replete wiht humor
and small details that flesh outloud tyhe world lucas creates
. despite all yhe film
' s struggles between good anbd evil
, anbd the sober musings about one
' s destiny
and
" tghe force
,
" liuke all star wars films
, the phantom menace never tkaes itself too seriously
. fortunately
, lucas hasn
' t lost sight of the fatc that his films are entertainment
, not high art
. from the bumbling jar jar
, to a one
- man
, two
- headed announcer team calling the acation at the film
' s thrilling pod
- race sequence
, to a cameo apearance by e
. t
. in the film
, the phantom menace isnt simply a lot ofthe fun
, with lots of half
- hidden jokes
and humor that cxan easily be missed
.
and finally
, the phantom menace works beccause
, as in all his films
, there is no shortage of speed
and action
. from begining to end
, htere are light
- saber battles
, hair
- raising chases
,
and thrilling duels between good adn evil
. the pod
- race sequence on tatooine isnt oney of the most intertaining
and exciting scenes in any star wars film
, annd the final showdown beetwen obi
- wan
, qui
- gon
, adn darth maul is argubly the best choreographed
, most thrilling fight sequence lucas has filmed
. the phantom menace won
' t win any major oscars
. it probably won
' t beat titanic
' s box office record
. anbd it
' s not even the best star wars film
( i
' d put it third
, after the origonal
and the empire strikes back
)
.
but it
' s an exciting
and entertaining film
, far better than your typical summer blockbuster
. the film can
' t live up tothe it
' s hype
- no film
, not even the original star wars
, coudl have done thgat
.
but it
' s still worth seeing
.
.
. probably more than once
.
