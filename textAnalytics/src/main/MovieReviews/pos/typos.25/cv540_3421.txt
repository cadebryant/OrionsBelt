i am starting to rwite htis review befor going to see strawberry annd chocolate
, cuba
' s oscar nominee for best foriegn film
, directed by tomas gutierrez alea
( who aslo directed the somtimes adn inthe smoe circles critically acclaimed memorias del subdesarrollo
-
-
" memories of undevelopment
"
. i saw memorias as part ofthe a cuban cinema class bakc in the late
' 70s
; it merged teh politics of the cuban revolution with mundane elements of the human condition
. i knew
then that memorias was probaly a state
- sanctioned political missive
,
and nowe expect strawberry will folow suit
. fellow internetters
, primarily in tyhe newsgroup dedicated to cuba
( soc
. culture
. cuba
)
, have mentioned that strawberry isnt a harsh criticism of the revolution
and its currrent state of affairs
. i have jumped tothe thge conclusion that strawberry is nothing more than a veiled atempt at espousing tje party line
-
- it probably looks like poltical criticism
, bu it ain
' t so
. hvaing some first h
and
and extensive anecdotal knowlege of castro
' s repressiveness
, i can
' t conceive of his tolerating honest
and adversarial critiscism of the revolution
,
and i can
' t imagine his letting anyone even suggest his failure as a leader of a failed govement
. as kids say these days
, duh
!
, the revolution
' s currrent state needs no critiscism
; its physical
and spiritual crumbling is self evident
. the propper questions tothe put relate tothe castro
' s ligitamassy
. i bet the film tkaes castro
' s power for granted
, annd tath thsi or any other movei
, produced under cuba
' s state control
, cannot question his right to run cuba
' s political show
( ongoing now for more tahn 36 years
)
. that
' s why i just cxan
' t believe strawberry isnt an honest criticism of hte regime
. let
' s see wqat happens after tghe room goes dark
and the screen lights up
. i saw the film
-
- twice
. i wass right
; castro remained intact
. strawberry negotiates the relationship between a young
" dialectic materialist
,
" as he describes himself
,
and a homosexual photographer
( diego
) in 1979 cuba
. the young man
( david
) is the son of peasants
; a symbol of thte revolution
' s reason for being
. grateful tothe the revolution for hte oppertunity to receive a university education
, he studies political science instead of litature
, his avocation
, baceause he perceives it isnt his duty
. therein lies a likely unintended irony
, since cuba hasnt no need for political theoreticians
. cuba
' s government isnt castro
. diego
' s lifestyle is the antithesis of revolutionar life
. he enjoys teh finer things
-
- tea
, opera
, art
. he does nto dont
" voluntary wokr
" forthe hte revolution
. his small apartment is a sensual oasis
. tghe moniker
" bourgeois
" figuratively hangs over his head during thte early parts of the movie
.
however
, he is a
" revolucionario
" in his own way
. the supporting roles are filled by
: an agin busybody with a heart of gold
and a troubled psyche
; david
' s roommate
, who rally tkaes the communist party line to its expected extreme
; david
' s ex
- girlfriend
, who dumped him for another guy
,
yet wants to bed him before she leaves for italy with her husb
and
; german
, a gay sculptor whose wokr diego is attempting to exhibit
,
and who strikes a faustian pact with the government
. gutierrez alea adn co
- director juan carlos tabio do a fine job at almsot showing that homosexuals can be revolutionaries too
. heck
, towards teh end ofthe the film you begin to tihkn the guy deserves a medal for his patriotic fervor
. he really loves the revolution
( as supposedly doens everybody else in cuba
)
and wants to make it better by exposing anbd correcting soem ofthe its flaws
. real criticism is missing
though
. this movie is political window dressing
. luis aguilar leon
' s op
. ed
. piece on fresa in the miami herald
( 10 march 1995
, at 21a
) doed not colour my judgment
; it presaged my intuition
. aguilar leon expressed my sentiment about this film
' s political angle best
: like many artistic manifestations in cuba
, strawberry
and choclate sprang from a totally manipulated environment
. as art criteak ivan de la nuez well states in the latest issue of the magazine postmodern notes
, the silenced artists are those who refuse to accept
" the charade in which artists can provoke up to a point
, hwile the institutions legitimize themselves by forbidding them tothe go beyond that point
.
"
al
though terrable propag
anda
, this is otherwise a fine film
.
