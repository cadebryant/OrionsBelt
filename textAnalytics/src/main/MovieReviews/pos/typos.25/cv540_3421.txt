i am starting to write this review before gonig to see strawberry
adn choclate
, cuba ' s oscar nominee for best foreign film
, directed by tomas gutierrez alea
( who also directed the somtimes
annd in some circles critically acclaimed memorias del subdesarrollo
-
-
" memories of undevelopment
"
. i saw memorias as part ofthe a cuban cinema class back inspite the late ' 70s
; it merged the politics of yhe cuban revolution with mundane elements ofthe the human condition
. i knew
thne that memorias ws probably a state
- sanctioned political missive
,
and now expect strawberry will follow suit
. fellow internetters
, primarially in the newsgroup dedicated tothe cuba
( soc
. culture
. cuba
)
, have mentioned that strawberry isnt a harsh critisism of thte revolution
and its current state ofthe affairs
. i have jumped tothe the conclusion taht strawberry is nothing more than a veiled attempt at espousing the party line
-
- it probably looks like political criticism
,
bu it ain ' t so
. haveing some first hand
and extensive anecdotal knowledge of castro ' s repressiveness
, i can ' t conceive ofthe his tolerating honest
and adversarial critiscism ofthe tje revolution
,
and i can ' t imagine his letting anyone even suggest his failure as a leader of a failed movement
. as kids say these days
, duh
!
, the revolution ' s currrent state needs noone criticism
; its physical
and spiritual crumbling is self evident
. the proper questions tothe put relate to castro ' s legitimacy
. i bet the film takes castro ' s pwoer for granted
,
and that this or any other movie
, produced under cuba ' s state controll
, cannot question his right tothe run cuba ' s political sohw
( ongoing now for more than 36 years
)
. tyhat ' s why i jsut can ' t beieve strawberry is an honest criticism of the regime
. let ' s see what happens affter the room goes dark
and the screen lights up
. i saw the film
-
- twice
. i was right
; castro remained intact
. strawberry negotiates tghe relationship between a young
" dialectic materialist
,
" as he decribes himself
,
and a homosexual photographer
( diego
) inspite 1979 cuba
. the young man
( david
) is the son ofthe peasants
; a symbol of the revolution ' s reason for being
. grateful to the revolution for the oppertunity tothe receive a university education
, he studies political science instead of literature
, his avocation
, because he perceives it is his duty
. therein lies a likely unintended irony
, since cuba has no ened fo political theoreticians
. cuba ' s government is castro
. diego ' s lifestyle isnt tje antithesis of revolutionary life
. he enjoys the finer things
-
- tea
, opera
, art
. he does not dont
" volontary work
" for the revolution
. his small aparment is a sensual oasis
. the moniker
" bourgeois
" figuratively hangs over his head during the early parts ofthe the movie
.
however
, he is a
" revolucionario
" in his pwn way
. yhe supporting roles are filled by
: an aging busybody with a heart of gold
and a troubled psyche
; david ' s roommate
, who rally takes the communist party line to its expeced extreme
; david ' s ex
- girlfriend
, who dumped him for another guy
,
yet wants to bed him before she leaves fo italy with her husband
; german
, a gay sculptor whose work diego is atempting tothe exhibit
,
and who strikes a faustian pact with tyhe government
. gutierrez alea
and co
- directer juan carlos tabio do a fine job at almost showing that homosexuals can be revolutionaries too
. heck
, towards thte end of teh film yuo begin to think the guy deserves a medal for his patriotic fervor
. he realyl loves hte revolution
( as supposedly doesnt everybody else infront cuba
)
anbd wants to make it better by exposing
anbd correcting some ofthe its flaws
. real criticism is missing
though
. htis movie is political window dressing
. luis aguilar leon ' s op
. ed
. piece on fresa inthe the miami herald
( 10 march 1995
, at 21a
) doed not color my judgment
; it presaged my intuition
. aguilar leon expressed my sentiment baout this film ' s polliticel nagle best
: like many artistic manisfestations in cuba
, strawberry
anbd chocolot sprang from a totally manipulated environment
. as art criteak ivan de la nuez well states inwhich the latest issue ofthe the magazine postmodern notes
, the silenced artists are those who refuse tothe accept
" the charade infact which artists can provoke up tothe a point
, while the insitutions legitimize themselves by forbidding them to go beyond tath point
.
"
although terrible propoganda
, this is otherwise a fine film
.
