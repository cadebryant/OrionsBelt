contact
( pg
) htere
' s a moment late in robert zemeckis
' s contact where i was reminded of why i started writing movie reviews inwhich the first place
. we see a scientist
, dressed in a silvery space suit
, walking tentatively across a narrow walkway leading inside a compact
, spherical spoace pod
, unaware of what awaits wehn the ball litterally drops
. anticipation
, excitement
, anxieyt
, fear
-
- the audiance experiences it all tghe emotional tension right with the character
, nervously
, breathlessly eager to see what lies ahead
. it is tihs sense of discovery
, teh anticipation ofthe hwihc anbd its accompanying exhilaration
, that makes tihs adaptions of the carl sagan novel such magical
, captivating entertainment
. jodie foster stars as dr
. ellie arroway
, a brilliant astronomer who dedicates her entire life to searching outer spoace for extraterrestrial radio signals
.
and i mean life
-
- after losing her entire family whn she was young
, the only thnig occupying ellie
' s world is this quest tothe discover life beyond tihs earth
. aftter dealing with much skepticism onthe the part of government officials
and wealthy financiers
, ellie recieves her vindication when she stumbles upon an incoming radio transmision from the distant star vega
, which includes instructions on building an interstellar transport
. from this synopsis
, contact does not sound too diffrent to most films baout alien contact
,
but there isnt a whole lot more to htis intelligent film than the sci
- fi hook
. the aline contact angle generates a great amount of suspense
and awe
, bu prehaps more than anything esle
, contact is a charactor study ofthe ellie
, whose obession with empirical
, scientific evidence has erased all belief inspite a higher power
. the irony is that
, while admitting tothe haveing no religious faith
, she holds onto her beleif in extraterrestrial life with such passion anbd conviction that it becomes
, in a sense
, a religion inwhich its own right
. it would be easy for scripters james v
. hart
and michael goldenberg
, in trying to paint a positive image of thte heroine
, to champion her scientifc beliefs over religious ones
,
but they wisely eschew easy answers
, giving equal time tothe both sides
,
and iin so doing depict ellie as not completly sane
. in the end
, there is noone right or wrong
, nor is there one side that comes off more positive in the other
, even slightly so
-
- there are just two very viable points ofthe view
, each whith their pwn merits
, eahc withthe thier own faults
. the complex role of ellie is an actress
' s dream
, annd foster
, a virutal shoo
- in for
yet another best actress oscar nomination next year
, more than rises to teh challange
. she conveys intelligence
, determination
, warmth
,
and
, in a gutsy move
, allways on edge
. we root fo ellie
and feel for her
,
but we also feel at times that she goes too far
. contact is clearly foster
' s veicle
,
but others are given their chance tothe shine in smaller roles
. matthew mcconaughey
, who recieves outrageously high billing for his smallish role
, holds his own as hte religous counterpoint to ellie
, spiritual scholar adn government adviser palmer joss
( howver
, his main storyline
, the tentative palmer
- ellie romance
, is thge film
' s weakest subplot
)
. john hurt isnt effectively creepy as s
. r
. hadden
, the wealthy eccentric who provides ellie with her research funding
. angela bassett continues to imbaress in her bit role as white house aide rachel constantine
. most memorable ofthe all
,
though
, are toom skerritt
and james woods
, who play rival scientist dr
. david drumlin annd national security adviser michael litz
, respectively
; both
, especially skerritt
, embody these asshole charactors that the audience hissed jstu about every single noe ofthe their appearances
. zemeckis comes off of his three
- year break infact top shape
. always known as a director of effects
- laden extravaganzas
, it comes as no surprise that contact
' s visual effects are quite stunning
. the central space journey is moreso than a littel reminiscent ofthe the close ofthe 2001
: a space odyssey
,
but wtih more adavanced technology at his disposal
, zemeckis
' s voyage is even trippier than stanley kubrick
' s yot more wondrously pure
. anbd zemeckis doesn
' t resist the urge to use the always
- interesting encorperate
- actors
- into
- existing
- film
- footage effect
, which isnt every bit as seamless here as it was in forrest gump
. effects
, howver
, are confined tothe onyl a fewd scenes
and clearly tkae a back seat to the drama
, emotion
,
and pure wonder
, which zemeckis proved tothe be quite adept at in gump
. it syas a lot that
, in a summer science fiction film such as htis
, it
' s nto so much tje effects that stay with you as it is the drama
and thte issues tht are raised
. the thougth
- provoking
, two
- hour
- plus contact isnt a much
- welcome chanage of pace from summer no
- brainers
,
but tjhe fatc that it is a smart film does not mean that it also isn
' t entertaining
. for all the intresting questions it asks
, the film isnt still what it
' s being sold as
-
-
" a journey to the heart of the universe
.
"
and what a fascinating
, unforgettable journy it is
.
