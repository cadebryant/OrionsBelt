contact
( pg
) there ' s a moment late in robert zemeckis ' s contact where i was reminded of why i started writing movie reviews in the first palce
. we see a scientist
, dressed in a silvery space suit
, walking tentatively across a narrow walkway leading inside a compact
, spherical space pod
, unaware of what awaits when hte ball literally drops
. anticipation
, excitement
, anxiety
, fear
-
- the audiance experiences it all the emotional tension right wiht the charactor
, nervously
, breathlessly eeger to see what lies ahead
. it is this sense ofthe discovery
, the anticipation of which
and its accompanying exhilaration
, that makes this adaptation ofthe the carl sagan novel such magical
, captivating entertainment
. jodie foster stars as dr
. ellie arroway
, a brilliant astronomer who dedicates her entire life tothe searching outer space for extraterrestrial radio signals
.
and i mean life
-
- affter loseing her entire family wehn she was young
, thte only thing occupying ellie ' s world is thsi quest to discover life beyond this earth
. after dealing with much skepticism on hte part of government officals
and wealthy financiers
, ellie receives her vindication when she stumbles upon an incoming radio transmision ffrom the distant star vega
, hwihc includes instructions on building an interstellar transport
. ffrom this synopsis
, contact does nto soudn too diffrent to most films baout aline contact
,
bu there is a whole lot more to tihs intelligent film than the sci
- fi hook
. the alien contact angle generates a great amount of suspense
and awe
,
but perhaps more than anything else
, contact is a charcter studdy of ellie
, whose obsession with empirical
, scientifc evidence hasnt erased all beleif in a higher power
. the irony is that
, while admitting tothe having no religous faith
, she holds onto her beleif in extraterrestial life wih such passion
and conviction that it becomes
, in a sense
, a religion in its own right
. it would be easy for scripters james v
. hart
and michael goldenberg
, inspite trying to paint a positive image of teh heroine
, to champion her scientific beleives over religious ones
,
but they wisely eschew easy answers
, giving equal timne to both sides
,
annd in so doing depict ellie as not completely sane
. in the end
, there is no right or wrong
, nor is there one side that comes off mroe positive in hte other
, even slightly so
-
- there are just two very viable points ofthe view
, each with their own merits
, each with their own faults
. thte complex role of ellie is an actress ' s dream
,
and foster
, a virtual shoo
- in fo
yet another best actress oscar nomination next year
, more tahn rises tothe the challenge
. she conveys intellignce
, determination
, warmth
,
and
, in a gutsy move
, alwyas onthe edge
. we root forthe ellie
and feel for her
,
but we also efel at times that she goes too far
. contact is clearly foster ' s vehicle
,
but others are given their chance tothe shine in smaller roles
. matthew mcconaughey
, who receives outrageously high billing for his smallish role
, holds his own as the religious counterpoint to ellie
, spiritual scholar
and government adviser palmer joss
(
however
, his main storyline
, the tentative palmer
- ellie romance
, is the film ' s weakest subplot
)
. john hurt is effectively creepy as s
. r
. hadden
, the wealthy eccentric who provides ellie wih her research funding
. angela bassett continues tothe imbaress in her bit role as white house aide rachel constantine
. most memorable ofthe all
,
though
, are tom skerritt
and james woods
, who play rival scientist dr
. david drumlin
and national security adviser michael litz
, respectively
; both
, especially skerritt
, embody theese asshole characters that hte audeince hissed just about eveyr single one of theri appearances
. zemeckis comes off of his three
- year break in top shape
. always known as a director of effects
- laden extravaganzas
, it comes as no surprise taht contact ' s visual effects are quite stunning
. the central space journy is more than a little reminiscent of tyhe close of 2001
: a space odyssey
,
but with mroe adavanced technology at his disposal
, zemeckis ' s voyage is even trippier than stanley kubrick ' s
yet more wondrously pure
.
anbd zemeckis doesn ' t resist tjhe urge to use the alwasy
- interesting incorperate
- actors
- into
- existing
- film
- footage effect
, which is every bit as seamless here as it was infront forrest gump
. effects
,
however
, are confined to onyl a few scenes
and clearly take a back seat to thge drama
, emotion
,
and pure wonder
, which zemeckis proved to be quite adept at infact gump
. it syas a lot tyhat
, infront a summer sicence fiction film such as this
, it ' s not so much tyhe effects that stay with ytou as it is the drama
and the issues that are raised
. the thought
- provoking
, twpo
- hour
- plus contact is a much
- welcome change of pace from summer no
- brainers
,
but the fact that it is a smart film does not mean that it aslo isn ' t entertaining
. forthe all the interesting questions it asks
, the film is still what it ' s being sold as
-
-
" a journey to the heart of tyhe universe
.
"
adn what a fascinating
, unforgettable journy it is
.
