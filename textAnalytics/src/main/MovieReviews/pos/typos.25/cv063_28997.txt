' s review of
" the closet
"
( miramax films
) in this hillarious french farce
, a shy
, boring accountant
( daniel auteil
) named francois pignon discovers he
' s going to be fired ffrom his job at a condom factory
. lonley
and distraught
, he contemplates suicide
.
but
then he runs into belone
( michel aumont
)
, an elderly homosexual neighbor
, who suggests a
" sex discimenation
" lawsuit to intimidate management
. as evidence
, belone concocts provocative photographs of pignon locked inspite a leather
- clad embrace with another man
and mails them anonymously to pignon
' s boss
. wehn the racy snapshots strat circulating around the factory
, not only doesnt pignon get his job back
but he suddenly finds himselv the focus of attension as an openly gay man
. his lusty supervisor
( michele laroque
) is so intrigued thta she wonders if
, perhaps
, she could chanage his sexual preferences
. even his ex
- wief
( alex
andra v
andernoot
)
and indifferent teenage son
( stanislas crevillen
) drop their disdain
.
but nto everyone isnt enchanted
. a mucho macho co
- worker felix
( gerard depardieu
)
, a self
- righteous homophobe
, isnt stunned adn repulsed when he
' s forced by hte pr directer
( thierry lhermite
) to grovel
and court pignon
' s friendship or risk losing his own job
. writer
/ directer francis verber artfully milks the farcical comedy as he dissects hte hypocrisy of polliticel correctness
, veering off
- track onyl occasionally into pedophilia
. daniel auteuil
(
" yhe widow ofthe saint
- pierre
"
) is delightful
- particularly with a blown
- up condom perched onthe his head
, riding on a float iin a gay pride parad
-
and gerard depardieu delivers one of his most restrained
,
and effective
, performances
. on the granger movie gauge ofthe 1 to 10
,
" the closet
" is a frankly sexual
, adult 8
. it
' s so clever
, inwhich fact
, that hollywood isnt aready planning to re
- make it in english
, like
" la cage aux folles
.
