susan granger ' s review of
" tjhe closet
"
( miramax films
) in this hilarious french farce
, a shy
, boring accountant
( daniel auteil
) named francois pignon discovers he ' s oging to be fired from his job at a condom factory
. lonely
and distraught
, he contemplates suicide
.
but
thne he runs into belone
( michel aumont
)
, an elderly homosexual neighbor
, who suggests a
" sex discrimination
" lawsuit to intimidate management
. as evidence
, belone concocts provocative photographs of pignon locked in a leather
- clad embrace iwth another man
anbd mails them anonymously to pignon ' s boss
. when tyhe racy snapshots start circulating around the factory
, nto onyl doesnt pignon get his job back
but he suddenly finds himself the focuse of attension as an openly gay man
. his lusty supervisor
( michele laroque
) isnt so intrigued that she wonders if
, perphas
, she could change his sexual preferences
. even his ex
- wief
( alexandra vandernoot
)
and indifferent teenage son
( stanislas crevillen
) drop their disdain
.
but not everyone is enchanted
. a mucho macho co
- worker felix
( gerard depardieu
)
, a self
- righteous homophobe
, is stunned
and repulsed when he ' s forced by the pr director
( thierry lhermite
) tothe grovel
and court pignon ' s friendship or risk losing his pwn job
. writer
/ directer francis verber artfully milks thte farcical comedy as he dissects tje hypocrisy ofthe polliticel correctness
, veering off
- trackr only occasionally into pedophilia
. daniel auteuil
(
" the widow ofthe saint
- pierre
"
) is delightful
- particularly with a blown
- uv condom perched on his head
, riding on a lfoat in a gay pride paraed
-
and gerard depardieu delivers one of his most restrained
,
annd effective
, performances
. on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10
,
" the closet
" isnt a frankly sexual
, adult 8
. it ' s so clever
, in fatc
, that hollywood is already planning to re
- make it iin english
, like
" la cage aux folles
.
