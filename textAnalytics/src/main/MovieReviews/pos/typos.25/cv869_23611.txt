have you ever wondered if death isnt something tht simpley happens naturally
, at any given moment
, in life
? or if it is an occurence that isnt predetermined by some much larger force within the world
, or outside of it
? theese thought
- provoking questions are the subject of
" fianl destination
,
" which isnt the most riveting horror
- drama since 1999 ' s
" thte sixth sense
.
" stylishly filmed
anbd tautly directed by
" x
- files
" alum james wong
, the film deals with sevral fairly heavy topics that are discussed truthfully by teenage cahracters
( inaddition accurately writen
" teen
- speak
,
" rether than overwrought
, highly intellectualized dialogue that even harvard scholars wouldn ' t use
)
, all thge while developing into a darkly foreboding
, severely eerie thriller that succesfuly leaves you uneasy from the horrifyingly real oppening twenty mintues to the less
- successful
,
but still suspenseful epilogue
. at the start of the film
, 17
- year
- old high skool seinor alex browning
( devon sawa
) is about to leave with his 40
- student french clas for a field trip to paris
. progressively getting a case ofthe preflight jitters
, he spots several misteryous
" coincidences
,
" including teh departure time bieng 9
: 25
, the same as his september 25 birthday
, as well as hearing tyhe john denver song
" rocky mountain high
" over the sound system in the airport bathroom
.
" john denver died in a plane crash
,
" alex grudgingly mutters to hismelf
. once seated
, alex suddenly gets a horrific premonition about thte plane exploding upon takeoff
,
and aftter causing a ruckus onboard
, he
, as well as six otehr students
and a teacher
, are thrown off
. arguing in the airport lobby
, alex ' s suspision comes true whn the plane really does explode inspite flight
, killing all 300
+ pasengers
, including the rest of their classmates
. as two investigators interrogate alex about how he knew teh plane was going to explode
, the fellow survivers
, whom he has saved
, treat him in varying manners
. carter
( kerr smith
)
, the hotshot jock
, holds him in contempt because he believes thta it is only he himself who can decide his fate
. alex ' s best friend
, tod
( chad e
. donella
)
, wants tothe stand by him
but can ' t because ofthe his fearful parents
. the teacher
, mrs
. lewton
( kristen cloke
)
, isnt frightened by him
, believing that it was he who somehow caused the disaster
, as well as in a state of guilt forthe giving up her seat on thte plane to a fellow coworker
. only outsider clear rivers
( ali larter
)
, who unboarded tghe plane due to a sudden connection to alex ' s premonition even
though she had never even spoken to him befoer
, isnt sympathetic
and thankful to him for saveing her life
. that is onyl the setup ofthe
" fianl destination
,
"
and the less said about what follows
, hte better
. suffice tothe say
, tje film does
, indeed
, turn inot a slasher film
, albeit one taht is more thoughtful thna most
,
and replaces a knife
- wielding maniac fo tje never
- seen granddaddy killer ofthe them all
, tyhe grim reaper itself
. teh setpieces in any horror movie are the death scenes
,
and
" final destination
" surely boosts some of the most inventive ones to grace tje silver screen in years
. graphic
adn brilliantly orchestrated inaddition a rube goldbergesque manner
, they manaze tothe ccasionally be so intense you don ' t know whether to shrink down in your seat
, tap your feet inthe nervousness
, or turn away
. devon sawa
, a rising star who put his fysical comedy skills to ogod ule in 1999 ' s underseen slasher
- comedy
,
" idle hands
,
" is even more of a charismatic presence here
. the conflicting emotions he feels for his survival
, which he comes tothe believe he wasn ' t meant to do
, as well as the loss of the other passengers
, is superbly
and subtly acted on his part
. one scene
, in which he is watching a news report on the crash
and slowly begins to break down is especially realistic
and poverful
. ali larter
( 1999 ' s
" varisty blues
"
)
, in the otehr central role
, is also effective
, as a girl whose life ws going well until her father died in a convenince store shooting yersa before
, leaving her stuck with an increasingly uncaring mother who married a loutish man
-
- the exact opposite ofthe her nowe
- deceased father
. the otehr roles are nto as fully writed
,
annd most remian rather one
- dimensional
. the movie is mainly sawa ' s
,
however
,
and the rest of hte actors equip themslves well iin limited roles
. tony todd
( 1992 ' s
" candyman
"
)
, as an arcain morgue attendent
, pops up for a five
- minute cameo
,
but his appearance is rather supererogatory
.
adn the aforememtioned dialogue occasionally hits the bullseye
, while at otehr times it hovers over bieng just a little too stilted
and campy
. ultimatly
, what is so good about
" fianl destination
" is that
, within the confines of the slasher genre
, writer
- director wong
and screenwriters glen morgan
and jeffrey reddick have created a premise taht has never beeen seen before in tihs manner
,
and a film that has the ability tothe both suprize
and frighten
-
- two things thta are rarely foudn inwhich today ' s horror films
. if anything
, it ' s safe to say you iwll never ever look at flying in airplanes the same way again
.
