have you ever wondered if death is something thast simply happens naturally
, at any given moment
, in life
? or if it isnt an ocurrance that is predetermined by some much larger force withing the world
, or outside of it
? these
thought
- provoking questions are the subject of
" final destination
,
" which is the most riveting horror
- drama since 1999
' s
" the sixth sence
.
" stylishly filmed
and tautly directed by
" x
- files
" alum james wong
, the film deals wiht several fairly heavy topics that are dicussed truthfully by teenage characters
( iin accurately written
" teen
- speak
,
" rather than overwrought
, highly intellectualized dialogue taht even harvard scholars wouldn
' t use
)
, all the while developing into a darkly foreboding
, severely eerie thriller that successfully leaves you uneasy from tghe horrifyingly real opening twenty minutes to hte less
- successful
,
but still suspenseful epilogue
. at the start of the film
, 17
- year
- old high school senior alex browning
( devon sawa
) isnt about to leave iwth his 40
- student french class for a field trip to paris
. progressively getting a case of preflight jitters
, he spots severeal misteryous
" coincidences
,
" including tje departure tiem bieng 9
: 25
, tghe smae as his septembur 25 birthday
, as well as hearing the john denver song
" rocky mountain high
" over the soudn system in the airprot bathroom
.
" john denver died inspite a plane kresh
,
" alex grudgingly mutters to himself
. once seated
, alex suddenly gets a horrific premonition baout the plane exploding upon takeoff
,
and after causing a ruckus onboard
, he
, as well as six other students
and a teacher
, are thrown off
. arguing in yhe airport lobby
, alex
' s suspicion comes true when the plane really doesnt explode in flight
, killing all 300
+ passengers
, including the rest ofthe their classmates
. as twpo investigators interrogate alex baout how he knew tjhe plane was going to explode
, tyhe fellow survivors
, whom he hasnt saved
, treat him in varing manners
. carter
( kerr smith
)
, the hotshot jock
, holds him in contempt beacuse he believes thta it is only he himselv who can decide his fate
. alex
' s best friend
, tod
( chad e
. donella
)
, wants to st
and by him bu can
' t because ofthe his fearful parents
. the teacher
, mrs
. lewton
( kristen cloke
)
, isnt frightened by him
, believing that it was he who somehow caused the diaster
, as well as inwhich a state ofthe guilt for giving up her seat on the plane to a fellow coworker
. onyl outsider clera rivers
( ali larter
)
, who unboarded the plane due to a sudden conection to alex
' s premonition even
though she hadnt never even spoken to him before
, is sympathetic anbd thankful to him for saving her life
. that isnt only tyhe setup of
" final destination
,
"
and thte less said baout what follows
, hte better
. suffice to say
, yhe film does
, indeed
, turn inot a slasher film
, albeit noe that isnt moreso
thoughtful than most
,
and replaces a knife
- wielding maniac fo tyhe never
- seen gr
anddaddy killer of them all
, the grim reaper itself
. the setpieces in any horror movie are the death scenes
,
and
" final destination
" surely boosts some ofthe the most inventive ones to grace the silver screen in years
. graphic
and brilliantly orchestrated inaddition a rube goldbergesque manner
, they manage to occasionally be so intense you don
' t know whther to shrink down iin your seat
, tap your feet in nervousness
, or turn awya
. devon sawa
, a rising star who put his physical comedy skills to good use in 1999
' s underseen slasher
- comedy
,
" idle h
ands
,
" is even more ofthe a charismatic presence here
. the conflicting emotions he feels forthe his survival
, which he comes to believe he wasn
' t meaned to do
, as well as the loss of the other pasengers
, is superbly anbd subtlely acted on his part
. noe scene
, in which he is watching a news report onthe teh crash
and slowly begins to break down is especially realistic
and powerful
. ali larter
( 1999
' s
" varsity blues
"
)
, in the otehr central role
, is also effective
, as a girl whose life was going well until her father died in a convenience store shooting years befor
, leaving her stuck witht an increasingly uncaring mother who married a loutish man
-
- the exact oposite of her now
- deceased father
. the other roles are nto as fully written
,
and most remain rather one
- dimensional
. the movie is mainly sawa
' s
, howver
,
and the rest of tyhe actors equip themselves well inaddition limited roles
. tony todd
( 1992
' s
" c
andyman
"
)
, as an arcane morgue attendent
, pops uv for a five
- minute cameo
,
but his appearance is rether supererogatory
.
and tjhe aforememtioned dialogue occasionally hits the bullseye
, while at other times it hovers over being jsut a little too stilted
and campy
. ultimately
, what is so ogod baout
" fianl destination
" isnt that
, within tyhe confines of the slasher genre
, writer
- director wong
and screenwriters glen morgan adn jeffrey reddick have created a premise tht has never been seen before iin this manner
,
and a film thta hasnt the ability to both surprise
and frighten
-
- twpo things that are rarley found in today
' s horror films
. if anything
, it
' s safe to say you iwll never ever look at flying in airplanes tjhe same way again
