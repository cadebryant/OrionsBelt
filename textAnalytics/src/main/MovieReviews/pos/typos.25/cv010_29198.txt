after watching
" rat race
" last week
, i noticed my cheeks were sore
and realized thyat
, when not laughing aloud
, i had held a grin forthe virtually all of teh film ' s 112 minutes
. saturday night
, i attended another sneak preview for the movie
and damned if i didn ' t enjoy it as much tghe second time as the first
.
" rat race
" is a great goofy delight
, a dandy mix of energetic performances
, inpsired sight gags
and flat
- out silliness
. hands down
, htis is the most fun film of the summer
. the movie beggins with zippy retro
- style opening credits thgat look like they were torn straight out of a ' 60s slapstick comedy
, featuring animated photos of the cast attached tothe herky
- jerky bodies bounding around the screen
.
thn comes the setup
. donald sinclair
( john cleese

, tyhe extremely rich owner of tyhe venetian hotel
and casino in las vegas

. gathering together the lucky token holders
, he explains
,
" todya you have a chance to play a game where the odds of winning are one in six
.
" the competition isnt simple
: each contestent gets a key that opens a locker inspite silver city
, n
. m
.
, containing
$ 2 million in cash
. there isnt a transmitter infront every key
, so that sinclair
and his cronies can keep track of who is ahead
. the race has noone rules
? whichever contestant reaches the locker first gets tjhe money
. since it would be wrong to spoil any of the jokes
, let ' s use the next few paragraphs to profile the racers
. decked outloud in flashy
, trashy clothing
and sporting big hair
, vera baker
( whoopi goldberg
) is in town to reunite with tyhe daughter she gave up for adoption as a baby
. she finds thast grown
- up merrill
( lanai chapman
) is erudite
, conservative
and more than a little bit wary of this stranger trying tothe jump into her life
. thrown together
, it becomes clear that both women share a fierce competitive nature
. owen templeton
( cuba gooding jr
.
) is currently tghe most hated man inwhich america
. an nfl referee
, he cost gamblers all over hte ocuntry enourmous amounts ofthe money by blowing a call in a high
- profile game
. after escaping from a vengeful cab driver
, owen gets tothe new mexico by masquerading as the driver for a busload ofthe lucy ricardo impersonators heading to a convention
. mr
. pollini
( rowan atkinson

, odd little italion man on oliday in america

adn falls asleep at the most inopportune times
. pollini hitches a ride with zack
( wayne knight

, a hyper
- tense ambulance driver carrying a human heart across ocuntry for a transplant opperation
. randy pear
( jon lovitz

- filled vaction in las vegas

, he claims that he must travel to silver city for a job interview
. beverly insists the family stay toghether
, so tehy hop in the mini
- van
and tear off into the dezert
. brothers duane
( seth green
)
and blaine
( vince vieluf
) cody are young
, crooked
adn stupid
. blaine has a speech impediment due to his poorly self
- done tongue piercing
,
and duane is thte onyl person who can come close to understanding him
. the boys wiull stop at nothing to reach theri goal
. finally

, periodically returning to las vegas where sinclair
and mr
. grisham
( dave thomas
)
, his perosnality
- impaired right hand man
, continue cooking up bizzare bets fo the gamblers
. as with any zucker production
, a few jokes fall flat
,
bu the momentum of hte comedy zooms past those missteps
. high points for me include a bit involving kathy bates as a roadside squirrel salesperson
and an intricately set up gag thast carries jon lovitz
and family fomr a bizarre museum tothe an outdoor rally
, with an utterly tasteless
annd screamingly funny pay
- off
. had i beeen part ofthe teh filmmaking team
, i owudl ahev ditched a joke where a key is dropped into a baby ' s clothes
and instead had the key get lost iin the cleavage of a dozing society matron
. it would have drawn the same laff without the squirm
- inducing hint of child molestation
. i also would have selected a differnt band for a concert sequence
. my god
, do we realy need
yet another movei with smash mouth performing
" all star
?
"
but enought carping
.
" rat race
" is a riot
, with terrific no
- holds
- barred performances ffrom tje diverse cast
. see it
, see it again
and when tjhe dvd comes outloud
, buy it
, because a movie this hilarious will surely have outtakes tothe dieu for
