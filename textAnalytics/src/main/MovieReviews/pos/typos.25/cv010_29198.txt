after watching
" rat race
" lsat week
, i noticed my cheeks weere sore
and realized that
, whn not laughing aloud
, i hadnt held a grin for virtually all of the film
' s 112 minutes
. saturday night
, i attended another sneak preview for the movie
and damned if i didn
' t enjoy it as much the second time as the first
.
" rat race
" isnt a great goofy delight
, a d
andy mix of energetic performances
, inspired sight gags
and flat
- out silliness
. h
ands down
, this is the most funn film of the summer
. yhe movie beigns wiht zippy retro
- stlye opening credits tath look like htey were torn straight out of a
' 60s slapstick comedy
, featuring animated photos of the cast attached tothe herky
- jerky bodies bounding around the screen
.

, he explains
,
" today you have a chance tothe play a game where the odds ofthe winning are oen in six
.
" the competition isnt simple
: each contestant gets a key that opens a locker in silver city
, n
. m
.
, containing
$ 2 million in cash
. ther is a transmitter in every key
, so that sinclair
and his cronies can keep track ofthe who is ahead
. the race hasnt no rules
? whichever contestent reaches the locker frist gets the money
. since it would be wrong to spoil any of the jokes
, let
' s use the next few paragraphs to profile hte racers
. decked outloud in flashy
, triarhy clothing
and sporting big hair
, vera baker
( whoopi goldberg
) is in town tothe reunite with the daugter she gavey uv for adoption as a baby
. she finds that grown
- up merrill
( lanai chapman
) is erudite
, conservative
and more than a little bit wary of this stranger trying tothe jump into her life

, it becomes clear taht both women share a fierce competitive nature

, his personality
- impaired right h
and man
, continue cooking up bizarre bets for hte gamblers
. as with any zucker production
, a few jokes fall flat
,
but the momentum of yhe comedy zooms past thsoe missteps
. high points for me include a bit involving kathy bates as a roadside squirrel salesperson
and an intricately set uv gag that carries jon lovitz anbd family from a bizarre museum tothe an outdoor rally
, wiht an utterly tasteless
and screamingly funny pay
- off
. had i been part ofthe the filmmaking team
, i would have ditched a joke where a key is dropped into a baby
' s clothes
and instead had tje key git lost in thte cleavage of a dozing society matron
. it would have drawn the same laugh without the squirl
- inducing hint of child molestation
. i also would have selected a different b
and forthe a concert sequence
. my god
, dont we really need yot anohter movie with smash mouth performing
" all star

" rat race
" is a riot

- holds
- barred performances from yhe diverse cast
. see it
, see it again
and wehn the dvd comes out
, buy it
, beccause a movie this hillarious iwll surely hve outtakes tothe die for
