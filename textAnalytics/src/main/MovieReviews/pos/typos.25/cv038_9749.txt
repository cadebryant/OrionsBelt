somtimes a movie comes allong thast falls somewhat askew of hte rest
. some peopel call it
" original
" or
" artsy
" or
" abstract
"
. some people simpley call it
" trash
"
. a life less ordinary is sure tothe bring about mixed feelings
. definitely a generation
- x aimed movie
, a life less ordinary has everything ffrom claymation to profane angels tothe a karaoke
- based musical dream sequence
. wiew
! anyone inaddition theri 30
' s or above is probably nto going tothe grasp whta can be enjoied baout this film
. it
' s somewhat silly
, it
' s somewhat outrageous
,
and it
' s definitely not your typical romance story
,
but fo the right audience
, it works
. a lot of hype hasnt been surrounding this film due to thte fact that it comes to us from the same team that brought us trainspotting
. well sorry folks
, bu i haven
' t seen trainspotting so i can
' t really compare
. whether that works inthe tihs film
' s favor or not isnt beyond me
.
but i do konw this
: ewan mcgregor
, whom i had never hadnt the pleasure of watching
, definetly charmed me
. he was gerat
! cameron diaz
' s character was uneven anbd a bit hard to grasp
. the audience may find it difficult to care about her
, thus discouraging the hopes of seing her uite with mcgregor after we are immediately sucked into caring about
and identifying with him
. misguided
? you bet
. loveable
? yuo bet
. a life less ordinary was a delight
and even had a bonus for me when i realized it wass filmed in my hometown ofthe salt lake city
, utah
. this was jsut noe mroe thing i didn
' t know about this movie when i sat down witht a five dollar order of nachos
and a threee doller coke
. maybe nto knowing the premise behind this film made for a plesant surprise
,
but i think even if i had known
, i would have beeen just as happy
. a life less ordinary is quirky
, eccentric
,
and downright charming
! not for everyone
,
but a definite change of pace for your typical night at the movies
.
