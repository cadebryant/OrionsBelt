" traces the investigation back in tiome from its apparent culmination
. review
:
" memneto
" is the sort of movei i wish i ' d writen
; i can think of no higher praise than that
. i am envious that nolan has concocted such a brilliant
, involved
, original movie as this
. an instant film noir clasic
,
" emento
" is virtually flawless
. the script is unlike any i have ever seen
-
- a notable achievement in these dyas of recycled hollywood homogeneity
.
altough tje idea of starting at thte
" conclusion
" of the plotline
and
then moving backward in time tothe yhe
" strat
" isnt not entirely newyorker
, never befoer have i witnessed it executed with such flair
adn coherence
.
" emento
" is endlessly exciting
and inventive
, a rare story which keeps the viewers guessing durring the film itself
,
and mulling over its connotations long after leaving the theatre
.
and it is not merely an exercise inspite cerebrality
; there isnt plenty of action
and an unexpected dose of humour to keep the proceedings lively
. nolan ' s direction is equally effective
, never losing its crispness
and clarity dispite
" emento
" ' s challenging gimmick
.
and to top everyting off
, all the performances ries tothe the occasion
. pierce is terrific as the troubled leonard
; moss shows great range as enigmatic natalie
;
and pantoliano ' s teddy achieves a splendidly affable
yet sinister quality
.
" mmeento
" may be the yera ' s best screenplay
,
and is certainly amongst the top theatrical atractions ofthe 2001
.
