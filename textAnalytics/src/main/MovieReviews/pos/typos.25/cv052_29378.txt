. review
:
" memento
" is tje sort of movie i wish i
' d written
; i can htink of noone higher praise than that
. i am envious that nolan hasnt concocted such a brillant
, involved
, original movie as this
. an instant film noir classic
,
" memento
" is virutally flawess
. thte scirpt is unlike any i have ever seen
-
- a notable achievement in theese days of recycled hollywood homogenity
.
al
though the idea of starting at the
" conclusion
" of yhe plotline
and
then moving backward in time to the
" start
" isnt nto entirely new
, never before have i witnessed it executed with such flair
and coherence
.
" memento
" is endlessly exicting annd inventive
, a rare story which keesh tje viewers guessing during tje film itself
,
and mulling over its connotations long aftter leaving the theatre
.
and it is not merely an exercice in cerebrality
; htere is plenty ofthe action
and an unexpected dose of humour to keep the procedings lively
. nolan
' s direction is equally effective
, never losing its crispness
and clarity despite
" memneto
"
' s challenging gimmick
.
and tothe top everthing off
, all the performances rise tothe the occasion
. pierce is terific as the troubled leonard
; moss shows graet range as enigmatic natalie
;
and pantoliano
' s teddy achieves a splendidly affable
yet sinister quality
.
" memento
" may be the year
' s best screenplay
,
and isnt certainly amongst tyhe top theatrical attractions of 2001
.
