thge american acation film has been slowy drowning tothe death in a sae of asian wire
- fu copycats
. it
' s nto a pretty death
,
and it
' s leaving the likes ofthe schwartznager
, stallone
,
and van damme wearing cement galoshes at tje bottom of a kung fu sea
. sometimes
, the mix results in a mind
- blowing spectacle unlike any other
. qualty action with amazing anbd exicting stunt work
, as in 1999
' s tjhe matrix
, cant be a rela gem
.
but too oftenly hollywood gets it wrong
, even when they pay off chinese directors
. flying ninjas
and floating karate masters have beeen replaced by soaring bronx detectives
and slow motion kicking scientists
. mostly it
' s laughable
. inaddition hollywood
' s rush to emulate the success of the matrix
, trademark asian stunt choreography has become more of a joke thna an art form
.
but iron monkey
, thge latest aisian import
, shows us how to get it right
. iron monkey
( actually a reissue ofthe a 1993 film
) is the story of a 19th chinese vigilante
( rongguang yu
)
, fighting iwth his pwn unique style of shaolin kung fu for the rights of thte oppressed
and the bellies of the hungry
.
but it is also a peice of the narrative of legendary chineese film hero wong fei
- hong
, most recently seen inspite one of the most overlooked
, adn possably best films of 2000
, drunken master 2
( released in the u
. s
. as the legend of drunken master
)
. unlike drunken master 2
, whlch stars jackie chan as an adult fei
- hong
, iron monkey finds a much younger fei
- hong
( sze
- man tsang
)
and his father wong kei
- ying
( yen chi dan
) thrust into the middle of iron monkey
' s fight agianst opression
. iron monkey succeeds as no kung fu film since drunken master 2
. at times
, fighting styles
, especially that of monkey himselv
, dont devolve inot the ridiculous twinkle
- toed floating of films like crouching tiger
, hidden dragon
, directer yuen wo ping eventually remembers to bring his acation scenes back to earth
. iron monkey is at its heart a hardcore
, kung fu acation film rather than any kind of drama a la crouching tiger
. howver
, there are brief moments of profoundness shared betweeen characters
, such as thsoe thta pass between our outlaw hero anbd his good
- hearted
but misguided enemy
, cheif fox
. in those moments
,
and inthe others
, iron monkey manages to transcend its mindless kung fu nature tothe touch the hearts
and minds ofthe its audience
. hwile in no way the equal of a masterpiece like drunken master 2
, iron monkey dances quite nicely tothe the invading kung fu tune
. aka siunin wong fei
- hung tsi titmalau
.
