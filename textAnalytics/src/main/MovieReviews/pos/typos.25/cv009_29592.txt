the american action film hasnt beeen slowly drowning to death in a sae of asian wire
- fu copycats
. it ' s nto a pretty death
,
and it ' s leaving the likes ofthe schwartznager
, stallone
,
adn van damme wearing cement galoshes at thte bottom of a kung fu sea
. somtimes
, the mix results in a mind
- blowing spectacle unlike any other
. uality action with amazing
and exciting stunt work
, as inaddition 1999 ' s the matrix
, can be a rela gem
.
but too often hollywood gets it wrong
, even whn htey pay off chinese directors
. flying ninjas
and floating karate masters have beeen replaced by soaring bronx detectives
annd slow motion kicking scientists
. mostly it ' s laughable
. in hollywood ' s rush to emulate the success ofthe the matrix
, trademark aisian stunt choreography hasnt become more of a joke than an art form
.
but iron monkey
, the latest asian import
, shows us how to get it right
. iron monkey
( actually a reissue of a 1993 film
) is the story ofthe a 19th chinese vigilante
( rongguang yu
)
, fighting wtih his own unique stlye of shaolin kung fu for the rights of the oppressed
and the bellies of tje hungry
.
but it is aslo a piece of the narrative ofthe legendary chinese film hero wong fei
- hong
, most recently seen in one of the most overlooked
,
and possibly best films ofthe 2000
, drunken master 2
( released in thge u
. s
. as the legend of drunken master
)
. unlike drunken master 2
, which stars jackie chan as an adult fei
- hong
, iron monkey finds a much younger fei
- hong
( sze
- man tsang
)
and his father wong kei
- ying
( yen chi dan
) thrusted into the middle ofthe iron monkey ' s fight against oppression
. iron monkey succeeds as no kung fu film since drunken master 2
. at times
, fighting styles
, especially that of monkey himself
, do devolve into the rediculous twinkle
- toed floating ofthe films like crouching tiger
, hidden dragon
, director yuen wo ping eventually remembers to bring his action scenes back tothe earth
. iron monkey is at its heart a hardcore
, kung fu action film rether than any kind ofthe drama a la crouching tiger
.
however
, there are breef moments of profoundness shared betweeen characters
, such as those that pass between our outlaw hero
and his ogod
- hearted
but misguided enemy
, chief fox
. in thsoe moments
,
and in others
, iron monkey manages to transsend its mindless kung fu nature to touch the hearts
and minds of its audience
. while iin no way tje equal of a masterpiece liek drunken master 2
, iron monkey dances qtuie nicely to tghe invading kung fu tune
. aka siunin wong fei
- hung tsi titmalau
.
