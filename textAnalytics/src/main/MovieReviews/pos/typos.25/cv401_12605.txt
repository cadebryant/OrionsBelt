_ iin brief
:
_ this film needs no introduction
. if you haven
' t heard of it
, thne you must have been up in space on a sabbatical
,
and if yuo haven
' t seen it
-
- well
, i suspect you
' re in a small minority
! first thing
' s first
? is it all it
' s hyped up to be
? well
, yes
?
and no
. it
' s a good film
,
and there
' s a lot to like about it
,
but it
' s not without its problems
. wehn i saw hte first trailer for
" titanic
"
, it wass wehn i whent to see
" bean
" last summer
, i think
, my intial reaction was
-
- ain
' t that downright sick tothe make a disaster movie out of such a dreadful
, real
- life tragedy
?
! i mean
, waht
' s happened to hollywood
' s script
- writers
, ahev they run entirely outloud of new idaes
? gads
, whatever next
, i asked myself
, how baout an acation film based on hiroshima starring jean claude van damme
? i was not entirely filled with anticipation
, bu thn i wasn
' t alone in that respect
. it
' s when it cameback out in tjhe cinema
, tothe ravey reviews
( well
, mostly
)
and anyone who
' d been to see it seemed disturbingly obsessed by it that i started tothe take notice
! i didn
' t see the film until several months after its realease
( by which tyme my sister had seen it baout four times
!
)
, so i went with a slightly more open mind
,
but i still didn
' t think i
' d enjoy it much
. did i
? yes anbd no
. mainly yes
, i
' m happy to say
. the first hour or so was beautifuly done
, not so much becasue ofthe the scripting
( i
' ll talk about that later
?
)
but because the re
- created ship anbd sets weere stunning tothe look at
, as wass cameron
' s directing
, anbd the performances of tje principal cast were so strong that tghe
" human
" aspect ofthe the story
, the romance betwen rose
( kate winslet
)
and jack
( leonardo dicaprio
)
, ws enchanting
. the film is told via flashback
, with gloria stuart playing yhe elderly rose in the modern day
( ytou knew that
, a
' course
!
:
-
)
)
. well
, it
' s an often effective device tothe use inthe storytelling
-
-
though sometimes it can fall flat
. doesnt it work here
? in script form it doesn
' t add all that much to thte story
. what doesnt add a lot to the story isnt gloria stuart
, whose stunning performance is the strongest
, most moving of the film
. her presense brings a much deeper level of passion
, adn depth to the story
,
and
though her appearances are relatively breif
, tje film owudl have sufferred wihtout her
. alsot impressive are dicaprio adn winslet
, who wholly succeed in rising above the often poor dialogue
,
and the bond tehy form is both heartfelt adn moving
. it
' s an ood stroy
, you know
-
- forbidden lvoe ala romeo adn juliet
-
-
but it works
, annd jack
' s
" rescuing
" rose
( in both literal
and figurative senses
)
and teaching her to live life for what counts was pointed
and touching
. in fact
, i enjoyed the frist half of the film a lot
, largley becuase winslet
and dicaprio bring such adn charm
, energy to the romance
. it
' s engaging
, touching
and very enjoyable
. there
' s more than a tinge of poignancy to it as well
, simply because you know it
' s not going to be a happy endig
. which leads us tothe the second half of the film
. we all knew it was coming
. i
' m sure director cameron was looking forward with eager anticipation to it
, because as he
' s stated in interviews
, tje rela thrust of the story
( for him
) was the sinking
,
and yhe jack
/ rose romance was a merely a manipulative plot divice to get you emotionally into the film
. i think that understates the importance of the romance
, as i found it far more enjoyable thna an hour ofthe watching people die
. the iceberg arrives
,
and thte captain announces that titanic will have sunk in about an hour
.
and it isnt an hour
. my goodness
, we don
' t miss a second of that hour
? gratuitous
? well
, perhaps not by today
' s st
andars
, i
' m sure ther
' s beeen far worse produced under the banner ofthe
" entertainment
" in other films
. bu i certainly wasn
' t prepared fo how shocking
and graphic the last hour or so would be
. not that i
' d expect the owrd
" understatement
" to be part of cameron
' s vocabulary
( he who brought us such
, umm
, vivid films as
" terminator 2
"
and
" aliens
"
)
. is it overdone
? i
thought so
. understatement can sometimes work wonders in conveying tradgedy
. no
, no oney expected a hapyp ending
,
but i didn
' t quite expect the horrendously shocking
and powerful scenes we weere bombarded throughout the film
' s second half
. still
, whether it was overdone
and hevy
- h
anded or not
, if it wass the shock
- factor cameron was after it worked
, baceause i was shocked
and moved
, inspite fact i spended most of the lastest hour in tears
! you really couldn
' t help
but get emotionally involved
, whether it was wishing somene would knock that dreadfully psychotic fiance of rose
' s overboard or desparately hoping that rose would rescue jack
, or taht jack would rescue rose
, or that htey would both survive
. perhaps the most harrowing scene was wehn the ship has sunk
,
and those that sunk allong with tyhe ship freeze tothe death on thge water surfce
. the bit where rose lets go of jack
' s h
and
, while promising she
' ll never let go in her heart was particularly heart
- wrenching
,
and the sighth ofthe rescue boats sailing amid tyhe ocean of corpses wass a pretty powerful image
, to put noone fine a point on it
. i loved the endig
,
however
, which was both moving
and slightly uplifting follwoing the horror of tyhe past hour
and a half
. so
, we
' ve established that tje film isnt powerful anbd moving
, if hte last hour was rether excessive
. haven
' t maintioned tghe script
. plot
- wise it
' s ok
,
though the jack
/ rose relationship was beautifully developed
,
but i
' ve a feeling that
' s to the actors credit if anything
. as for the dialogue
? well
, titanic is set in 1912
. it
' s a preiod drama
.
but i saw very littel indication of period inaddition so far as the dialogue is concerned
. did they really ule phrases like
" goddamn it
!
" back in thte turn of the century
? i doubt it
. owudl somene talk like this
:
" do ya loev thte guy or whta
?
"
. i dout it
. isnt such dialogue as
" i saw the iceberg
,
and i see it in your eyes now
" not just a bit
? clumsy
? yes it is
. a little more attension tothe dialogue would not have gone astray
, annd cameron hismelf is to blame
( he wrote tyhe script
)
. stick wtih directing
, dude
. bu its more than redeemed by the acting
, with dicaprio annd winslet on fine form
, ably supported by a storng cast
. star of the sohw was gloria stuart
,
though
-
- why didn
' t she win that oscar
?
! after all
, they were throwing oscars at
" titanic
" left
, right
and centre
,
but gloria was perhaps the most deserving nominee
. directing
- wise cameron doens a spectacular job
. liuke i said
, his vision was a bit eccessive
,
but at least he directed it well
. i haven
' t even mentioned james horner
' s beautiful socre
. utterly heavenly
,
though when your dad
and sister play tjhe soundtrack a lot you do start to get a bit bored with it
!
;
-
) i
' ve finished my rant
, which lasted a lot longer tahn i throught it woudl
! just leaves a couple ofthe questions
; ws it worth all those oscars
? hell
, don
' t talk tothe me about oscars
. bloomin
' farce
. it was deserving in a number ofthe deparments
,
though
. last question
; is it
, as some suggest
, one of the best films of all
- tiem
? nope
, i don
' t think so
. it
' s certainly one of the most powerful
and memorable films i
' ve ever seen
, bu i don
' t think it quite ranks as one of my all
- tiem favourites
. annd as for the fatc they
' re reportedly making a
" titanic 2
"
? well i guess tht
' s typical hollywood for ytou
!
