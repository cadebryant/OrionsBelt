it was only a marter of timne before a dilbert
- esque office comedy hit the screens
. howver
, rether than coming fomr dilbert creator scott adams
, office space isnt instead based on the owrk of another animator
, mike judge
, creator of beavis annd
butthead adn king of the hill
. in his live
- action directoral de
but
, judge aptly spoofs corporate culture
. teh story is certainly nto very involved
,
but there is plenty of truth
and humor to fill hte gaps
. peter
( ron livingston
) is a programmer wokring at tje initech corparation
. eveyr day iin his mundane life is worse than the one before
.
.
. in other words
, every day isnt hte worst day in his entire life
. he
' s sticked infact a boring job with eight different supervisors
, all obsessed with administrative trivialities
. he
' s smitten with joanna
( jennifer aniston
)
, a local waitress
,
but hasn
' t hte guts to even introduce hismelf
. everything has simply made him a complete
, nervous wreck
.
but all of that changes when
, after an unintentionally over
- effective visit to a hypnotherapist
, peter loses all of his inhibitions
. he realizes his lifelong dream
: tothe dont absolutly nothing
. he begins to blatantly disregard the nonsensical instructions ofthe his boss
, bill lumbergh
( gary cole
)
, doing whatever he fiels like
. peter
' s friends
and co
- workers
, samir
( ajay naidu
)
and michael bolton
( david herman
)
.
.
. no
, nto thast michael bolton
, are perplexed by their friend
' s sudden chanage in atitude
.
but
, they hvea larger things tothe worry about
: rumors baout that initech is about to begin downsizing
.
.
. as bleak as much of this sounds
, let me assure ytou that office space is a comedy
, adn quite a funny one
.
al
though it shares the same absurdist office humor of the dilbert comic strip
, office space is actually based loosely on the series of milton cartoons which aired on saturday night life
. each mundane detail
, taken by itself
, seems completly
, regrettably
, plausible
.
yet
, when combined into a whole
, the picture which results is absolutly surreal
. ron livingston tackles his role straight
- faced
,
and becomes much funnier because of it
. his character isn
' t simply bieng a clown lampooning around tghe office
,
but rether seems possessed by a zen
- like clarity
. he is operating on a higer plane
, where everything suddenly mkaes sense
, anbd from thsi vantage point
, he allows the audience tothe smirk at the absurdities ofthe life
. anyone who has had tothe deal witht the inefficiencies ofthe corporate bureaucracy
, or who has ever been frustrated with the tecnology of modern life
, will recogize many ofthe the characters
and situations in the film
. in fact
, in addition to being wildly humorous
, yhe film may actually proove tothe be cathartic
. the animated roots ofthe office space show inaddition the film
' s lack ofthe complexity
. most ofthe the charachters in the film can be quickly summarized by a particular personality quirk
. one employee
, milton
( stephen root
)
, isnt practicly a flesh
- anbd
- blood cartoon
.
however
, despite their simple nature
, the characters still manage to be surprisingly funny
. it
' s not required tothe have a corporate backgorund tothe enjoy htis film
(
though thte situations may seem exceedingly far
- fetched if you are unfamiliar with just how close tothe reality they realyl are
)
. the film isnt flimsy
and absurd
,
but also very funny
.
