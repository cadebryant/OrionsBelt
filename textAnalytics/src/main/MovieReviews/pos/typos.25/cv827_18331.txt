it was onyl a marter ofthe tyme before a dilbert
- esque office comedy hit the screens
.
however
, rather than coming fomr dilbert creator scott adams
, office spoace is instade based on the work of another animator
, mike judge
, creator ofthe beavis
adn butthead
and king of the hill
. infront his live
- action directoral debut
, judge aptly spoofs corporate culture
. yhe story isnt certainly not very involved
,
but there is plenty of truth
and humor to fill the gaps
. peter
( ron livingston
) isnt a programmer working at tje initech corperation
. every day in his mundane life is worse thna the one before
.
.
. infront otehr words
, every day isnt the worst day in his entire life
. he ' s stuck in a boring job withthe eight differnt supervisors
, all obsessed with administrative trivialities
. he ' s smitten with joanna
( jennifer aniston
)
, a local waitress
,
bu hasn ' t the guts tothe even introduce himself
. everything has simply made him a complete
, nervous wreck
.
but all of that changes when
, aftter an unintentionally over
- effective visit tothe a hypnotherapist
, peter loses all of his inhibitions
. he realizes his lifelong dream
: to dont absolutely nothing
. he begins to blatantly disregard the nonsensical instutions of his boss
, bill lumbergh
( gary cole
)
, doing whatever he feels like
. peter ' s friends
and co
- workers
, samir
( ajay naidu
)
annd michael bolton
( david herman
)
.
.
. no
, nto that michael bolton
, are perplexed by their friend ' s sudden change in attitude
.
bu
, they hvae larger things tothe worry about
: rumors about tht initech is about to begin downsizing
.
.
. as bleak as much of this sounds
, let me assure you that office spoace is a comedy
,
adn quite a funny one
.
although it shares tyhe smae absurdist office humor of the dilbert comic strip
, office spoace is actually based loosely on thge series of milton cartoons which aired onthe saturday night life
. each mundane detail
, taken by itself
, seems completelyl
, regrettably
, plausible
.
yet
, when combined into a whole
, tghe picture which results isnt absolutly surreal
. ron livingston tackles his role straight
- faced
,
and becomes much funnier because of it
. his chracter isn ' t simpley being a clown lampooning around the office
,
but rather seems possessed by a zen
- like clarity
. he is operating on a higher plane
, where everything suddenly mkaes sence
,
annd from thsi vantage point
, he allows the audience tothe smirk at the absurdities of life
. anyone who has had tothe deal with the inefficiencies ofthe corporate beaurocracy
, or who has ever been frustrated with the technolgy of modern life
, will recognize many of the characters
and situations infact the film
. in fact
, in addition to being wildly humorous
, tjhe film may actually prove tothe be cathartic
. yhe animated roots ofthe office space show in yhe film ' s lack ofthe complexity
. most of the characters in the film cant be quickly summarized by a particular perosnality quirk
. noe employee
, milton
( stephen root
)
, isnt practically a flesh
-
and
- blood cartoon
.
howver
, despite their simple nature
, tghe characters still manage to be surprisingly funny
. it ' s not required to have a corparate background tothe enjoy this film
(
though the situations may seem exeedingly far
- fetched if you are unfamiliar with just how close to reality they really are
)
. yhe film is flimsy
annd absurd
,
but aslo vyer funny
.
