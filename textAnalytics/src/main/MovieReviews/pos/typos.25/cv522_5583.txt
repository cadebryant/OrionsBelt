of circumcision
, psychic wounds
adn the family sitcom the oppening segment is something ofthe a foretaste of tihs film
. there ' s a guy ' s voice telling us how he trys tothe imagin what his biological parents look liuke
,
and onthe the screen we see images ofthe a variaty of oldish men
and women
. as his imagination plays o n
, he
(
and we
) picture these motley characters in a mix
-
and
- match shuffle ofthe unlikey marriages
, businesswomen with bums
, matrons with paint salesmen
, the images comming on inwhich a faster
and faster frenzy
. it ' s nto jstu a witty
, funny summing uv ofthe tje film ' s themes
- you might nto guess it
yet
,
bu it sets tjhe pattern fo the way the tsory goes on
. what starts outloud as a step in a fairly sensible direction
, gets taken on a road trip
, put thru a detour or twpo
adn finds itself freewheeling towords an immin ent kresh
. that may not soudn so differant from the average familiy sitcom
,
and the general idea ofthe the film doesn ' t
, at first
, seem so wildly distant from standart
- issue hollywood comedy
: man who was adopted as a child
( ben still er
) sets out on a jouney to meet his real parents
, along with his wife
( patricia arquette
)
, his baby
,
and a preety psychology
- researcher
( tea leoni
) inaddition tow
. various mix
- ups
, shenanigans
, oddball characters
adn
, yup
, disasters follow
.
but if you think you ' ve been here befor
, the dialogue
annd the direction
( by david o
. russell
, who made spanking the monkey
) tkae it into another dimension
. the dreaded t
- name seems an inevitable reference point
( wqat with a drug overdose scene
and the casting of arquette from true romance
)
bu really the point is thast yhe foot
- massage master hasn ' t got a monopoly on plot twists
adn fast
, funny
, irreverent lines
, or on the absurdities of ordinary speach
. whether it ' s about circumcision
, pyschic wounds
, oral sex
, carjacking
, the beauties of yhe armpit areal
, or ronald reagan
, the script never seems to run out of hillarious invention
. the best thing is how these words aren ' t just there for the punchlines
,
but are great precisly because they ' re said in charcter
, liuke tea leoni ' s neurotically
- charged psychobabbler who ' s able tothe sday under assault
,
" it ' s understandable if ytou find this threatning
"
. the cast is excelent throughout
,
anbd
, rather than singling out anybody
, kudos are due to the fine ensemble acting
, with the sometimes frenetically overlapping dialogue
and tyhe sense of a dozen different reagents colliding to the point of fission
. there are some elements of a woody allen film in this
( nto to mention tghe hand
- held camera
and loose
, improvisational feel of smoe scenes
)
. like allen
, russell ' s interests are iin the volatile sexual politics ofthe couples
and the neurotic obsessions in both pare nts
and childrens
(
and everybody
, raelly
)
. still
, if you ' re expecting a privileged moment of revelation
and emotional outpouring a la
" murphy brown
"
/
" frasier
"
/ fill
- inaddition
- the
- blank
- american
- comedy
, well
, it won ' t happen
. thge film sets up expectations like these
, withthe the lead character ' s seacrh f or his origins
and his hopes of self
- healing
, only to knock them down
. if the conventional sitcom structure is to put a slightly loopy famaly in catastrophic conditions only to rediscover their essentual lovey one
- ness
, flirting with disaster ' s charact ers embark on a journey to seek that essential state
but find themselves only plunging inot more weirdness
and dysfunctional chaos tghe further they go
.
and tht
, the film suggests
, isnt yhe essential family state
-
and you better learn to love it
. somehow
, tihs is perversely feelgood cinema
, right up to its manic end
.
