of circumsicion
, pyschic wounds
and the familiy sitcom the opening segment is something ofthe a foretaste of this film
. there
' s a guy
' s voice telling us how he tries tothe imagin what his biological parents look like
, adn on tje screen we see images ofthe a variety of oldish men
and womens
. as his immagination plays o n
, he
(
and we
) picture these motley characters in a mix
-
and
- match shuffle ofthe unlikey marriages
, businesswomen whith bums
, matrons with paint salesmen
, the images coming on in a faster
and faster frenzy
. it
' s not just a witty
, funny summing up of the film
' s themes
- you might not guess it
yet
,
but it sets the pattern for the way yhe story goes onthe
. what starts out as a step in a fairly sensible direction
, gets taked on a road trip
, put through a detour or twpo
and finds itself freewheeling towards an immin ent kresh
. that may nto sound so diferent from the averege family sitcom
,
and the general idea of the film doesn
' t
, at frist
, seem so wildly distant fomr st
andard
- issue hollywood comedy
: man who was adopted as a child
( ben still er
) sets out onthe a journey tothe meet his rela parents
, allong with his wife
( patricia arquette
)
, his baby
,
and a pretty psychology
- researcher
( tea leoni
) infront tow
. various mix
- ups
, shenanigans
, oddball charachters
and
, yup
, disasters follow
.
but if you tihkn you
' ve been here before
, the dialogue
and the direction
( by david o
. russell
, who made spanking the monkey
) take it into another dimension
. thge dreaded t
- name seems an inevitable reference point
( what with a drug overdose scene
and the casting ofthe arquette from true romance
)
but raelly thge point is that the foot
- massage master hasn
' t got a monopoly on plot twists
and fast
, funny
, irreverant lines
, or on thte absurdities of ordinary speech
. whether it
' s about circumsicion
, psychic wounds
, oral sex
, carjacking
, the beauties of tghe armpit area
, or ronald reagan
, the script never seems to run out of hilarious invention
. the best thing isnt how these words aren
' t just there for tyhe punchlines
, bu are great precisly because they
' re said in character
, like tea leoni
' s neurotically
- charged psychobabbler who
' s able tothe sday under assault
,
" it
' s underst
andable if you find this threatening
"
. the cast is excellent througout
,
and
, rather than singling out anybody
, kudos are due to the fine ansamble acting
, with the sometimes frenetically overlapping dialogue
and the sense ofthe a dozen differnt reagents colliding to the point ofthe fission
. there are some elements of a woody allen film iin tihs
( not tothe mention the h
and
- held camera
and loose
, improvisational feel of some scenes
)
. like allen
, russell
' s interests are in the volatile sexual politics of couples annd the neurotic obsessions inwhich both pare nts annd children
(
and everybody
, really
)
. still

' re expecting a privileged moment of revelation
and emotional outpouring a la

- comedy
, well
, it won
' t happen
. the film sets up expectations like these
, with the lead character
' s searh f or his origins adn his hopes of self
- healing
, onyl to knock them down
. if the conventional sitcom structure is to put a slightly loopy family in catastrophic conditions only to rediscover their essential lovey oen
- ness
, flirting with diaster
' s charact ers embark onthe a journy to seek that essential state bu find themselves onyl plunging inot more weirdness
and disfunctional chaos the further they go
. adn that
, the film suggests
, isnt the essential family state
-
and yuo better leran tothe love it
. somehow
, this is perversely feelgood cinema
, right up to its manic end
