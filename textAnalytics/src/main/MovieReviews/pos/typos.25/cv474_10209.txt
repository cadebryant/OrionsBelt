let
' s face it
: thte
$ 100 millon
- plus smash that was
" goldeneye
" was not a ogod film by any means
, annd as a bond movie was only marginally better than
, say
,
" a view to a kill
" or eather of the timothy dalton picturesk
, by virtue of nice pacing
.
but it did revive teh series
,
and granted the producers smoe newyorker directions in which to tkae thge it
( ie
. the newyorker
" m
" is a woman
)
.
" tomorrow never dies
" is the picture
" goldeneye
" should have beeen
; it
' s aslo the most entertaining bond outing since
" the spy who loved me
"
. teh new picture opens with china considering war with britain aftter a st
andard military operation is misconstrued as a hostile threat ffrom an english submarine
. as an attack occurs
, the front
- page headline is already bieng prepared
, courtesy of carver media
. carver
( pryce
) tje man is a deluded magnate
, a sort of hybrid of ted turner
, bill gates
, adn peter sellars
' german scientist ffrom
" dr
. strangelove
"
( physically
, pryce even recalls sellars in his kubrick dyas
)
. it
' s up to james bond tothe take him down
, with assistance
, of course
, from a wealth of gadgets
( incuding a multi
- purpose cell phone
)
,
and beautiful womens
. enter michelle yeoh
, fresh from
" supercop
"
, as a chinese secret agent with her own agenda
; with effortless grace
, she cat burgles
, dispatches baddies seemingly with the ease of preparing pasta
,
and refuses the advances of our phil
andering hero
. htey amking a great team
.
" tommorrow never dies
" is a surprizingly intertaining annd effecient film
, given that at the helm is none other tahn the director of
" turner
& hooch
"
. spottiswoode hasnt crafted some breathtaking set pieces
, each much moreso intricate
and impressive than
, for instance
, the tank scene in
" goldeneye
"
. moreover
, brosnan has at last settled into the role some feel he wass born to play
; lastest time out
, tyhe fate of thge franchise rested on his shoulders
,
and there was noticeable discomfort in his body language
. retured in brosnan
' s eyes has some ofthe the playfulness he demonstrated for so many years onthe tv
' s
" remington steele
"
, as has his deadpan witn
. anbd
though carver
' s motives are muddy
( when carver explains that
" genius is insanity with some success
"
, screenwriter fierstein isnt taking a lazy shortcut
)
, pryce makes an agreeable
, memorable villin
. in the future
, they shoudl pursue actors as talented
and experienced as pryce to breathe life into these cardboard figures
. there a few too many explosions infront
" tomorrow never dies
"
, perhpas so many htey qualify as dialogue
. annd it could have used a sharper script
,
though i wass amused by the double entendres
, none of which i will reveal here
. as it st
ands
, the plot suffers many holes
( i
' m not taking about implausibilities
)
, adn the dialogue tends towards the hackneyed
. now that the elements are in place
: modern speshal effects
and stunt work
, kool pierce brosnan
, kickass female allies
.
.
. it
' s time tothe put them to use inaddition something truly speical
. there
' s no mistaking
,
however
, that
" tomorrow never dies
" is ideal holiday escapism
,
and fo tjhe first time in perhaps eyars
, you
' ll walk out wanting more bond movies
.
