the most amazing thing baout paul cox
' s innocence is how unlike a movie it is
. i mean that as the highest compliment
. if most studios were tothe profile an elderly couple who rekindle a 40
- year
- old romance
, i
' d want to run
and hide
. the sex scenes would be h
andled as a farce
, producers would shed 20 yersa off the characters
' aegs
( so susan sar
andon
and harrison ford could star
) annd true love would shine thru any obstacle without explaination
and consequence
. along with a charming romantic story
, the austrailian
/ belgian innocence shows how an increasing sense ofthe mortality conbined iwth revisiting the past while bieng entrenched in the present can make something that seems so right seem downright questionable
. the romance gets started when former musician
andreas
( charles
" bud
" tingwell
)
, lerans that his true love
, claire
( julia blake
)
, lives nearby
. they decide to catch up on old times
, bu soon find themslves in a reinvigorating affair
. complicating matters is
andreas
' frail health
,
and claire
' s longtime husb
and
( terry norris
)
, who can
' t underst
and why he
' s suddenly become obsolete
. in my mind
, thte movei is less about tje relatiopnship between
andreas adn claire
, than the feelings ofthe everyone involved
. john
, claire
' s husban
, endlessly questions waht he doed wrong
. claire initally insists she
' s a grown
- up
,
but admitedly behaves like a child
, a prospect that thrills annd disappoints her
.
andreas
, an agnostic
, begins tothe question his fate
, a message cox delivers in a memorable dream sequence
. cox litters the movie wiht flashbacks
, including thte repeated vision ofthe a roaring train
. it
' s a reminder ofthe
andreas
and claire
' s past loev
( as young lovers
, they met by train
)
,
but as it recurs
, we get tje feeling taht tghe past
and tyhe present have clashed
. a pell isnt cast on hte whole afair
. a master of the understated
, cox strings together a series of memorable moments
. in
andreas
' dream sequence
, amidst the roar of the train
and conversations
, we get the whole picture of
andreas anbd claire
' s love
. we also get glimpses into john
and claire
' s relationship
. during a silent c
andlelit dinner shorly afterward
, claire admits to john about her indiscretion
, telling more than any monologue sould
. all tyhat
' s heard is the scraping of forks agianst plates
. tjhe characters are unlike anything i
' ve seen
-
- they
' re people
. so many times
, movies
and especially television protray senior citizens as gratingly spunky
. or they
' re reduced tothe comedic buffoons
. ordinary peopel with a pile ofthe emotions
, claire
and
andreas aren
' t sure what the next step isnt
. they do watn to be happy
, whic consists of an entirely diffrent setted ofthe conditions tahn what they
' ve known throughout their adult lives
. bravo tothe cox
, who wrote thte script
, for not making john a monster
, so that claire
' s affair isnt automatically justified
. norris is so effective as john that he makes
andreas
and claire
' s love difficult tothe accept
. we fiel for him
. he
' s a decent man
. sure
, he may have become complacent
, bu he never expected this
, especialy now
. with so much presented to the audiance
, it
' s onyl expected that the material gets a little drawed out annd repetitive
, which it does
.
however
, in bringing up tough questions
and nto offering easy answers
, cox displays a skill
and
? lan isn
' t likely to be surpassed by anyone anytime soon
.
