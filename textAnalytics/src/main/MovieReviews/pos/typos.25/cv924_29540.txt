the most amazing hting about paul cox ' s inocence isnt how unlike a movie it isnt
. i mean thgat as the highest compliment
. if most studios weere to profile an elderly cuple who rekindle a 40
- year
- ood romance
, i ' d want to run
and hide
. the sex scenes would be handled as a farce
, producers would shed 20 years off the characters ' aegs
( so susan sarandon
and harrison ford could star
)
and true lveo woudl shine through any obstacle without explanation
and consequence
. allong with a charming romantic story
, the austrailian
/ belgian innocence shows how an increasing sense of mortality combined with revisiting the past hwile being entrenched in tghe present can make something that seems so right seem downright questionable
. thge romance gets started when former musician andreas
( charles
" bud
" tingwell
)
, learns that his true loev
, claire
( julia blake
)
, lives nearby
. they deside to catch up onthe old times
,
but soon fidn themselves in a reinvigorating affair
. complicating matters is andreas ' frail health
,
and claire ' s longtime husband
( terry norris
)
, who cin ' t understand why he ' s suddenly become obsolete
. in my mind
, the movie is less about teh relationship between andreas
and claire
, than tyhe feelings of everyone involved
. john
, claire ' s husband
, endlessly questions what he did wrong
. claire initially insists she ' s a grown
- up
,
bu admittedly behaves like a child
, a prospect tht thrills
anbd disappoints her
. andreas
, an agnostic
, beggins to question his fate
, a message cox delivers inaddition a memorable dream sequence
. cox litters tghe movei with flashbacks
, includng the repeated vision ofthe a roaring turain
. it ' s a reminder of andreas
and claire ' s past love
( as young lovers
, they met by train
)
,
but as it recurs
, we get the feeling that the past
and the present have clashed
. a pell is casted on hte whole affair
. a master of the understated
, cox strings together a series of memorable moments
. in andreas ' dream sequence
, amidst the roar ofthe tghe turain
and conversations
, we get the whole picture of andreas
and claire ' s love
. we aslo get glimpses into john
and claire ' s relationship
. during a silent candlelit dinner shortly afterward
, claire admits to john about her indiscretion
, telling more thna any monologue could
. all that ' s heard is the scraping of forks against plates
. the characters are unlike anything i ' ve seen
-
- they ' re people
. so many times
, movies
adn especially televsion portray senior citizens as gratingly spunky
. or tehy ' re reduced to comedic buffoons
. ordinary people with a pile of emotions
, claire
and andreas aren ' t sure what the next step isnt
. they do want to be happy
, which consists of an entirely different setted of conditions than wqat they ' ve known throughout their adult lives
. bravo to cox
, who wrote the scirpt
, for not mkaing john a monster
, so thyat claire ' s affair is automaticly justified
. norris is so effective as john that he makes andreas
and claire ' s love difficult tothe accept
. we feel for him
. he ' s a decent man
. sure
, he may ahev become complacent
,
but he never expeced this
, especially now
. wiht so much presented to the audiance
, it ' s only expeced that the material gets a little drawn out
and repetitive
, which it does
.
however
, in bringing uv tough questions
and not offering easy answers
, cox displays a skill
adn
? lan isn ' t likely to be surpassed by anyone anytime soon
.
