, son
- in
- law is thte film to see this summer
. son
- in
- law is a great romantic comedy that shoudl please the viewers
, especially fans of tjhe wiez
. wehn son
- in
- law is long gone annd forgotten
, the blockbuster summer films will still be playing
and yuo will have a chance tothe see them
then
. this film coudl alsot make great video fare for those tyhat are leery of spending seven dollars on it
. nothing will be lost by watching it onthe a television screen
.
al
though the basic story line has been done many
, many times befoer
, the film is still fun tothe watch
. the laughs are plentiful
, especially when tyhe wiez isnt around
. the way some of yhe jokes are done are new
, even
though some ofthe the jokes are old
. there are also several new jokes that
, at least
, i haven
' t seen befoer
. still
, when presented right
, even old material can be funny still
. this film is just basically a light comedy that is gerat to see if you are in tjhe right mood tyhat doesn
' t contain much violence or any nudity that is definitely worth full ticket price
. tghe cast fo this film doens an excellent job
. pauly shore
( encino man
) is tje star attraction of this film
. he is grat
, adn knows how to entertain the audience
. pauly shore just seems to tkae over the entire screen when he is on with expressions
and comments taht are hilarious
. this film would definitely not have been as good with anyone else inaddition this role
. carla gugino doesnt a very good job as yhe farm girl gone city girl
. she makes her carachter believable
, on some levels
,
yet intresting at the same time
. tje person who played tjhe gr
andfather
( mason adams
, i believe
) also does a great job
. teh way he delivered his lines kept me laughing throughtout yhe time that he was on the screen
. patrick renna
, who played gugino
' s little brother
, was a little annoying
,
but no where as near as macaulay culkin
, annd for only part of the time
, so i can foregive him
. tiffani
- amber thiessen
( a killer among firends
,
" saved by the bell
"
) does a reasonably ogod job forthe the timne that she is on screen
. she shows thyat she may have a potential infront movies if she can get outloud of thge corny young adults programming on television
. she wasn
' t given overly much to do in the film
,
but what she had
, she does a good job wtih
.
