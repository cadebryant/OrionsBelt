i nkwo tht
" funnest
" isn
' t a word
.
" funn
" is a noun
,
and therefore cannnot be conjugated liuke an adjective
.
but tht
' s tghe word taht came to me right aftter viewing
" chicken run
.
" no wonder
: this is the kind of movie thyat reduces ytou tothe childish expressions
, like
" that was teh funnest movie i
' ve ever seen
!
" so to hell iwth webster

-
" chicken run
" is one of the funnest movies i
' ve seen in a while
. i can
' t rember the lsat tyme i
' ve seen anything funner
. tyhe chickens at tweedy
' s farm are up to something
. living in a concentration camp
- like athmosphere
, htey are led by one plucky hen called ginger
( voice ofthe julia sawalha
) who constinually comes up with plans for excape
-
-
and alwyas gets caught
, subsequently spending day aftter day inaddition the coal box
. one nght
, a brash american rooster flies inthe over tghe fence
, calling hismelf rocky
( mel gibson
)
, famous flying rooster anbd circus performer
. rocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly
,
and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs
. tweedy
( mir
anda richardson
) decides tothe ab
andon the farm
' s egg
- selling plan fo a pie
- selling plan
. she orders a huge py
- makeing machine
, cackling
,
" chickens go in
; pies come outloud
.
" whta sort ofthe pies
? chicken pies
, of course
. co
- director nick park
and his studio
, aardman animation
, produced three oscar
- winning short films
:
" creature comforts
,
"
" the wrong trousers
,
"
and
" a close shave
.
" the latter two weere yhe second
and third installments ofthe a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace
& gromit
, a man
and his dog famous for getting themselfs into increasingly peculiar adventures
. part ofthe what made yhe
" wallace
" films brilliantly entertaining was park
' s uncanny abillity tothe make an old story seem newyorker
.
" the wrong trousers
,
" for exemple
, pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks
,
and
" a close shave
" owed a great deal ofthe inspiration to classic detective stories
.
but in the h
ands ofthe park
and his team
, the stories felt fresh
and inspired
,
and not the least bit contrived
. nowe teaming with co
- director peter lord
, park hasnt creaeted a similar creature infact
" chicken run
.
" the plot is largely lifted fomr
" the great escape
"
( watch for a quick reference to the ball
- bouncing scene
)
, with smoe spielberg
- inspired action sequences providing the excitement
. thing is
, hte film doesn
' t feel liuke it
' s been lifted from somewhere alse
;
" chicken run
" feels fresh
, alive
, liek nothing else ever done
. part of it is the original diea
: who in tghe world came up with the idea to make a prisoners
- of
- war movei starring chickens
? park
and lord milk the incongruity forthe all it
' s worth
: tjhe characters treat their situation as if it were dead sereous
,
and to them
, it is
. bu htey
' re
* chickens
*
, so it
' s funny to us
. another thnig that helps
" chicken run
"
(
and most ofthe park
' s films
) succeed is the animators
' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they
' re cribbing
. there are references tothe
" tje great escape
,
" obviously
,
and
" stalag 17
.
" yhe chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both
" raiders of the lost ark
" annd
" indiana jones
and tjhe temple of doom
.
" ther
' s even a nod tothe
" the blues brothers
,
" if ytou can believe it
,
and the filmmakers even git inspite a little light
- hearted ribbing at the expence of their star voice actor
, taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson
' s nationality adn film history
. the
" braveheart
" reference is a hoot if you catch it
. when you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody adn a redundant oen
,
" chicken run
" is downright brilliant infact its execution
. consider htis
: usance july of last year
, i
' ve seen dozens apon dozens of
" blair witch project
" parodies
, on televsion
, on the radio
,
and online
. out of all those
, mabey noe or two were amusing
, the rest tiresome
. why
? because once you got past thge
thought that
" they
' re parodying that
' blair witch
' movie
,
" most of the parodies had nothing to offer
-
- noone insight
, no original idea
, no greater purpose
. they were only funny if yuo had seen yhe movie
; otherwise
, you got nothing
. conversely
,
" chicken run
" doesn
' t leanr onthe its parodies
-
- tjhe film refernces are never the sole focus of any scene
. if you
' ve never seen
" indiana jones
,
" the chase sequence isnt still fun
. even if you have no idae who mel gibson is
, rocky remeniss an interesting character
. park
, lord
,
and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience doens not need a parody shoved infact thier faces before it
' s understood
, annd as a result
,
" chicken run
" is filled with visual
and verbal jabs thast are never too obvious
,
but not quite vague eather
. enjoyment of this movei doesn
' t require knowledge of film history
,
but if ytou
' ve got it
,
" chicken run
" is taht much richer
. the voice cast turns in uniformly livley performances
,
and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it
' s hard nto tothe fall in love with every one ofthe them
. ginger isnt perfect
, spunky
and opinionated
, bu with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind
,
and julia sawalha
( known as the cute mousy girl onthe
" absolutly fabulous
"
) nails it
. she has warm
, human chemistry with gibson
, whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung
- ho veneer
. the charactors
' inevitable romance doesn
' t feel contrived
,
but sweet
. poor mr
. tweedy
( tony haygarth
) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way
,
but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out
, annd his overbearing wife certainly isn
' t any help
. jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs
( a hen that runs away iwth most of the best one
- liners
, all while perpetually crocheting a sweater
)
,
and two suply
- trading rats thyat seem to haev walked straight outloud of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during tyhe lively central swing
- dancing sequence
. htey even come up with an inpsired riff onthe something that
' s baffled scholars
and theologians aplikay for decades
: the chicken vs
. egg dilemma
. oen might hvae expected this inevitible joke tothe come off as wearisome
, bu as with most of
" chicken run
,
" it comes as a delightful surprise
. the film manages to cross all barriers
; it should be accessible to both children
and adults
, brits
and yanks
, rats
and chickens
. teh animation is first
- rate
. remember that this wass all done the old
- fashioned way
, with actuall humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit
,
and you see jsut how truley remarkable
" chicken run
" really is
. this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios
' animation great
: precise
and unwavering attension to detail
. as inspite such top
- notch famaly fare as
" a bug
' s life
" or
" toy story 2
,
"
" chicken run
" has something to offer in nearly eveyr frame
. certainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward stry withthe a worthwhile moral
and soem suprizingly touching scenes
,
but a active
, attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because htey
' ll catch all the details
. anyway
, the movie
' s just a boatload of fun
. funnest damn movie i
' ve seen all yearm
.
