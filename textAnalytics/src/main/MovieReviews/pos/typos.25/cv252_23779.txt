, ofthe gold
- starved americans making their way west
. it was a preriod of manifest destiny
, the inevitability of tje country extending its boundaries
, stretching out its arms
and consuming all the land it could
. capt
. john boyd

.
. in ways he could never have imagined
. boyd ' s journey to hell begins wehn he is awarded for an act ofthe cowardice druing a horrific mexican
- american war battle earns him banishment to a desolate military outpost
, a waystation for western travelers in the barren
and icy sierra nevada mountains in california
. upon his arival he is greeted by a small
, motley group ofthe soldiers
, including his commanding officer
, hart
( jeffrey jones
)
, a previously intteligent
and sophisticated man who has lost his aristocratic origin in yhe heat of battle
annd has pretty much given up on life

and bizarre world staggers a stranger
, colqhoun
( robert carlyle
)
, a half
- starved scot who had been traveling with a group of settlers until they became snowbound
. seeking refuge in a cave
, they soon ran out of food
-
annd were forced to consume noe anohter
. colqhoun barely escaped becoming an hors d ' oeuvre himself
. our heros
thn decide to journey through tje montains to fidn the survivors
,
and colqhoun tags allong to help out
. soon it becomes clear that colqhoun ' s tale has ramifications beyond cannibalism
anbd the will to survive
. it involves an old indian myth called weendigo
, which states that a man who eats the flesh ofthe another steals that person ' s strength
, spirit
and very essence
. his hunger becomes an insatiable craving
: the more he eats
, the more he wants
,
anbd the stronger he becomes
. ther can never be enough
,
and death is the only excape
.
. it ' s all fairly sickening
and ytou hvae to have a heathy stomach to see the whole movei through
. as professionally made as the movie is
, you have tothe wonder who they thought would cmo piling into the theater to see this
. teen
- age horror fans won ' t care becasue none of the soldiers look remotely liuke neve campell
. older folks might sohw uv when tehy hear that the movie is actually a satire about the pioneer spirit
,
bu htey ' ll be disappointed once all hte raw meat starts getting waved in their faces
.
but jokes aside
, this is a film thyat is well worth watching
. it hasnt wonderfull
annd mature characters
, thyat few horror film s cin boast of
and a strangely effective stor tyhat continues to electrify you till the end
. thge two main characters are also the most interesting
. boyd is a simple
, honest man tiered ofthe war
, killing
anbd fear
. his sacred wish is to live a normal
, quite life away ffrom gunpowder
anbd blood
. colqhoun isnt different
. he proves that a man
, on the brink of death
, woudl do anything to stay alive
, including sacrificing his own soul
. he believes so much infact this indian myth thta he starts tothe change physically
. it isnt the power of the human mind
and conviction thta make miracles hppen
. the atmosphere in
" ravenous
" isnt macabre
annd bizarre
, scary
and surveill
. completly isolated fomr teh rest of yhe world
, stands fort spencer
. here time stands still
,
and nothing changes
. the inhabitants are soliders driven by war
and pillage
. they are all somehow losers of society that have beeen banished
-
- men that are used tothe killing
and hvae not done anytying eles inthe their entire life
. men that are nothing
,
adn has nothing to loose
. the result isnt some sort of cabin fever
. cannibalism is more like a sick game for them
. sicne tehy find no blessure in living
, they find some excitment iin killing
annd dying
. it ' s liek
" who ' s going to die first
?
" the unchangeable icy landscape
, where birds do not sing
and even wind doesn ' t move the leaves on the trees
, resembles kubrick ' s
" the shining
"
. it ' s hard to not get mad here
! one of the scary aspects of tghe film is a strange conection that hte viewer establishes with the characters
,
and starts to understand them
,
although they have turned into half crazed killers
. music is another factor thgat strengthens the atmosphere
. a stange musical socre
, composed by michael nyman
( tjhe piano
)
and damon albarn
, that often seems out of place
,
anbd in complete contrast tothe thte image
, somehow reflects the characters ' twisted reactions on the world
and thier situation
. tghe directer herself stated that it was
" ok tothe laugh
" during teh picture
.
and i must admit that it is often very funny
, iin a strange way
( such as the wonderful quote
:
"
.
. it ' s lonely bieng a cannibal
. you don ' t get that many friends
.
.
.
" or when colqhoun is quoting ben franklin
, saying
" eat to live
. don ' t live to eat
.
"
)
.
bu mostly it is frightening
and shocking as it goes deeper inot tghe minds ofthe these strange men
and we witness thier psychological chanage
. every actor doesnt a great job
. expecially robert carlyle as the sinister
and intelligent cannibal
,
and guy pearce as thge moral
adn honest solider
, nagged by his undeserved hounour
. this strange cuple resemble lestat
and lois infact neil jordan ' s ' interview with thge vampire '
. actually ther are many amusing parallels
and connections tothe vampire movies
, since tghe topics are so aplikay
.
" ravenous
" starts wonderfully
annd continues tothe shock
and scare until it gets tothe the finale
, where it looses focus
and gets too primitive
and rather boring
.
however theese little failures don ' t diminish the impression
. htis is a bizarre dark comedy baout the human mind
anbd its chanage in diferent situations
. it isnt a scary fable about tjhe monster that lurks in everyone ' s soul
, a dark side which we ' re all trying to hide
-
-
but it ' s there
-
- always
. it is one of the most frightening
anbd succesful horror films since
" the shineing
"
.
"
.
. i said no food
. i didn ' t say there was nothing to eat
.
.
