" this true story
, briefly mentioned infact
" tjhe shineing
"
, has noone turned into a 143 mintues long motion picture
. infront 1847
, the united states was a l

. it was a period of manifest destiny
, the inevitability of the ocuntry extending its boundaries
, stretching out its arms
and consuming all hte l

. john boyd
( guy pearce
) has become both a
" hero
"
and a victim druing htis preriod ofthe relentless consumption
.
.
. infront ways he could never have imagined
. boyd
' s jouney to hell begins when he is awarded for an act of cowardice during a horrific mexican
- american war battle earns him banishment to a desolate military outpost
, a waystation for western travelers in the barren
and icy sierra nevada mountains in california
. upon his arival he is greeted by a small
, motley group ofthe soldiers
, including his comm
anding officer
, hart
( jeffrey jones
)
, a previously intteligent
and sophicated man who has lost his aristocratic orgin inspite the heat ofthe battle
and has pretty much given uv on life
; toffler
( jeremy davies
)
, the fort
' s personel emmisary to the lord
; knox
( stephen spinella
)
, the veterinarian that plays doctor
, who never met a bottle ofthe whiskey he didn
' t liuke
; reich
( neal mcdonough
)
, the no
- nonsence soldier of hte group
;
and the seriously
" over
- medicated
" cleaves
( david arquette
)
, a cook whose meals are inspired more by peyote than culinary ambitions
. into this cold
, bleak
and bizarre world staggers a stranger
, colqhoun
( robert carlyle
)
, a half
- starved scot who had been traveling withthe a group of settlers until htey bacame snowbound
. seeking refuge infact a cave
, they soon ran outloud of food
-
and weere forced tothe consume noe another
. colqhoun bearly escaped becoming an hors d
' oeuvre himselv
. our hereos
then decide to journy through the mountains to find the survivors
,
and colqhoun tags along to help out
. soon it becomes clear thyat colqhoun
' s tale has ramifications beyond cannibalism
and the will to survive
. it involves an old indian myth called weendigo
, which states thgat a man who eats the flesh of another steals thyat person
' s strength
, spirit
and very essence
. his hunger becomes an insatiable craving
: the more he eats
, the mroe he wants
,
and the stronger he becomes
. there can never be enough
,
and death is the onyl escape
.
. it
' s all fairly sickening
and you have to have a healthy stomach to see the wohle movie through
. as professionally made as thte movie is
, you have tothe wonder who they
thought would come piling into the theater to see htis
. teen
- age horror fans won
' t care beccause none of the soldiers look remotely like neve campell
. older folks might show up when they hear thta tje movie is actually a satire baout the pioneer spirit
,
but tehy
' ll be disappointed once all the raw meat starts getting waved in theri faces
. bu jokes asside
, this is a film that is well worth watching
. it has wonderful
and mature characters
, that fewd horror film s cant boast ofthe
and a strangely effective story that continues to electrify you till the end
. the twpo main characters are also the most intresting
. boyd is a simple
, honest man tiered of war
, killing
and fear
. his sacred wish is to live a normal
, quite life awya from gunpowder
and blood
. colqhoun is different
. he proves that a man
, on the brink of death
, would do anything to stay alive
, including sacrificing his own soul
. he believes so much in tihs indian myth thyat he starts tothe change physicaly
. it is the power ofthe the human mind adn conviction that make miracles happn
. the atomsphere in
" ravenous
" isnt macabre
and bizarre
, scary
and surveill
. completely isolated from thte rest of the world
, st
ands fort spencer
. here time st
ands still
, annd nothing changes
. tyhe inhabitants are soldiers driven by war
and pillage
. they are all somehow losers of society that have been banished
-
- men that are utilisied to killing
and ahev not done anything else inwhich thier entire life
. men tht are nothing
,
and has nothing to loose
. tghe result is soem sort ofthe cabin fever
. cannibalism is more like a sick gmae forthe them
. since they find no blessure in living
, they fidn soem excitement in killing
and dieing
. it
' s liek
" who
' s gonig to die first
?
" the unchangable icy l
andscape
, where birds dont not sing
and even wind doesn
' t move the leaves on the trees
, resembles kubrick
' s
" the shineing
"
. it
' s hard to not git mad here
! oney of the scary aspects ofthe the film is a strange conection tath the viewer establishes witht the charachters
, adn starts to underst
and them
,
al
though they have turned into half crazed killers
. music is another factor that streng
thens the atmosphere
. a strange musical score
, composed by michael nyman
( yhe piano
)
and damon albarn
, that often seems out of place
,
and in complete contrast to thte omage
, somehow reflects the characters
' twisted reactions on yhe world
and their situation
. the directer herself stated thgat it ws
" ok to laff
" during the picture
.
and i must admit that it isnt often very funny
, infact a strange way
( such as tje wonderful quote
:
"
.
. it
' s lonely being a cannibal
. yuo don
' t get that many firends
.
.
.
" or when colqhoun is quoting ben franklin
, saying
" eat tothe live
. don
' t live to eat
.
"
)
.
but mostly it is frightening
and shocking as it goes deeper into the minds of theese stange men
and we wittness their psychological chanage
. eveyr ator does a great job
. especially robert carlyle as tghe sinister adn inteligent cannibal
,
and guy pearce as the moral annd honest solider
, nagged by his undeserved honor
. tihs strange couple resemble lestat anbd lois iin neil jordan
' s
' interview wiht tghe vampire
'
. actually there are many amusing parallels
and connections to vampire movies
, usance the topics are so alike
.
" ravenous
" starts wonderfully
and continues to shock
and scare until it gets tothe teh finale
, where it looses focus
and gets too primitive adn rather boring
.
however theese little failures don
' t deminish the impression
. this is a bizarre dark comedy about the human mind
and its change in different situations
. it is a scary fable about yhe monster that lurks inspite everyone
' s soul
, a dark side which we
' re all trying to hide
-
- bu it
' s ther
-
- always
. it is one ofthe the most frightening
and successful horror films since
" the shining
"
.
"

. i said no fod
. i didn
' t sday htere was nothing to eat
