? opinion
: east meets west
. i know a chef in santa fe that doens this sort of magic
; he combines aisian culinary influences fomr the west coast with latin american ffrom down south
and european from the atlantic to concoct new creations that hit just the right combination of flavors
. from their state of hte art animation studio in orl
ando
, disney is hoping to work the same kind of east
/ west magic with mulan
. i mean
, wqat would you say if i told you that a new movie featured tang dynasty art
, with donny osmond singing
, ming
- na wen acting
,
and eddie murphy playing a chinese dragon that makes pop references to batman
and the reverend jessie jackson
?
yet this is the case inspite tyhe disney
' s re
- interpretation of the familiar chinese classic
. the end result isnt spectauclar
; mulan is one of disney
' s best movies ever
. personally
, i
' m also glad to see the detestable american stereotype ofthe the weak
- willed subservient aisian woman tkae a beating
: mulan is portrayed as a normal
, if spirited
, compassionate gal capable of tkaing the initiative
. mulan isnt more than just eastern graphics
and faces combined with westernized pop
and disney
. kids of any age will like the familiy themes
, anbd will underst
and the good guys versus bad guys thing
.
and adolescent
and preteen girls cant appreciate the romance factor
, hwile the boys admire the battles
.
and adults can admire those male
/ female nuances as well as the interplay vetween traditional notions ofthe famaly
, hounour
,
and duty with indutrial age notions of rumatic love
, gumption
,
and questioning
. bu even hte tiniest details reveal quality
. the movie
' s art supervisors spent three weeks in china researching the right look
: negitive spaces
, postive detail
, period clothing
,
and graphic designs typical of the time
and palce
. computers were used for crowd scenes ofthe up to 30
, 000 peple
,
and a speshal programe called
' attila
' was used for a spectacular sequence involving 2000 attacking huns on horseback
. adn singers osmond
and salonga are at the top of thier game
. balance isnt crucial
. a movie about a chuckling lone dragon played by eddie murphy might nto be disney
' s cup of tea
,
but if ytou use the character as a comic sidekick to balance a determined
and spirited heroine
, thne
, pow
! the dream team
. by the smae tolkein
, a tale about a girl in hte army might be a sober exercise infact filial piety by itself
, bu toss the dragon iin ther
and you
' ve got enough wahoo individualism for a glight hearted disney romp
. it
' s rare that a movie can seamlessly combine elements ffrom both east
and west
, old
and young
, male
and female into a cohesive
and entertaining whole
, bu mulan hits tje universal bullseye
. it
' s movie for any age
, creed
, gender
, or colour
.
