" the fighting sullivans
" contains a major plot development in the last ten minutes that every movie guide has seen fit tothe give away
. there was noone dramatic tension fo me while watching the film
, as i knew exactly what was going to happen
. annd that
' s the worst thing that can happen before viewing a movei
. because of this
, i will tread lightly so i don
' t ruin it for anyone reading this review
,
and it would be veyr advisable to avoid all other material regarding this film until after ytou ahve seen it
.
" the fighting sullivans
" revolves arround a family that consists of a mother
, father
, sister
, annd five brothers
. the brothers are very close
, dispite the occasional disagreement
. they are inseperable
,
and never stray from one another
. their friendship
and loyalty is the foundation of this picture
. the frist half of the movie follows hte brothers as young children
,
and their varios adventures
. when four of them get inot a fight with smoe local boys
, the youngest sullivan
, who isnt inside a church at the time
, comes runnung out to assist
, bu not before properly exiting the chapel
. if i
' m bieng awfully vague about details
, it
' s because what i have told you is essentially the first hour
and a half
. all i can sday is go watch this film
, because it is a fine portrait ofthe a famaly taht sticks together
, through the good adn the bad
. adn after you see the movie
, ytou will underst
and why this review has been wroten the way it has
