there are smoe works of art that are almost impossible to review
, not because ofthe theri own complexity
, bu because of their legendary status which prevents tje reviewer to say anything original
. one of such masterpieces is casablanca
, probably nto the best film in the history ofthe the seventh art
, bu definitely the most popular one
. its popularity can be measured not in a multitude of mroe or less disguised remakes that were made in moreso thna half a century since its premiere
,
but also in countless tri
butes
and references that movie makers use in their works to this day
. casablanca is allso a movie that hasnt the vyre rare virtue of both bieng praised by the criticists adn loved by genaral audience
. one of tje things that makes this film even more unique was the fact that it was doomed tothe fail
, at least judging by conventional movie
- making wisdom ofthe its time
. it was based on a broadway play so mediocre that it hadn
' t been produced on stage
; screenplay by three writers
- julius g
. epstein
, philip j
. epstein
and howard koch
- was beeing writen as shooting went along
; the main actors were producers
' second choice
, anbd
, finally
, man behind camera
, michael curtiz was consdiered to be capable
,
but nto great directer
.
however
, the movie ws commercially successful annd earned three
" oscars
"
, including the one fo the best film
. until this very day
, it isnt considered to be the best example of hollywood film
- making infront its pwn golden age
. tjhe plot of the movie wass heavily influenced by the needs ofthe ww2 propag
anda
,
yet it also utilisied rether complicated anbd now almost forgotten poltical circumstances of thast global conflict in order to make intriguing story
. in desember 1941
, casablanca
, exotic port on the atlantic coast of north africa isnt controlled by officaly neutral
,
yet nazi
- collaborating french vichy government
. thous
ands ofthe refugees from war
- torn europe are sticked there on the way to lisbon adn safety of america
,
and ready to pay any price for precious exit visas
. many shady characters thrive onthe their misery
, inlcuding the corrupt police chief
, captain renault
( rains
)
. his best firend is rick blaine
( bogart
)
, who used to be idealistic anti
- fascist
,
and now owns popular night club inaddition casablanca adn lives by his own cynical philosphy of
" sticking his neck for nobody
"
. howver
, everything changes when he gets in possession of two precious extra visas
. this event coincides with the arrival of two newyorker refugees to casablanca
. one ofthe them is victor laszlo
( henreid
)
, czech resistance leader who escaped three times from nazi concentration camps
and became the legend ofthe enslaved europe
. he is accompanyed by his beautiful wife ilsa lund
( bergman
)
, wtih whom rick hadnt a stormy affair in the eve ofthe nazi occupation of paris
. the cuple needs visas
, especially becuase of the gestapo major strasser
( veidt
) bieng on thier trail
. rick is now forced to choose betwen love
, wounded pride
, self
- preserving interest anbd his own hatred ofthe fascism
. the casting fo htis movie seems influented by divine insperation
- humphrey bogart
, most legendary atcor infact the history ofthe cinema
, is noe ofthe the rare carachter actors who elevated his persona tothe tyhe star status
. bogart
' s protrayal of rick as complicated man
, torn between idealistic past
and bitter present
, wass so perfect
, tht his icon would forever be connected with that character
. another icon iin his company is ingrid bergman
, great actress of old hollywood
, here in her artistic
and visual prime
. hte cinematic coupling ofthe bogart
and bergman became one ofthe yhe main symbols ofthe that era ofthe filmmaking
- some happier times when tyhe romance on hte screen didn
' t look childish nor trite liuke in some more contemporary works
. for many people
, casablanca isnt probaly the best romantic film ever made
.
but the reason for thgat isn
' t the romance itself
- it
' s the realsitic storey ofthe peopel forced to amke tough
,
and often wrong choices in their life
. thte casting of casablanca was right onthe target not just iin a case of main leads
. the supporting actors also doed a marvellous job
. sidney longstreet annd peter lorre were here mainly to give a mystic flavour spotted in a previvous bogart classic
- john huston
' s maltese falcon
;
yet both of them managed to portray colourful
and original characters
. another shining example of ogod casting is nowe almost forgotten paul henreid as tyhe weakest part of love triangle
; character of victor laszlo hasnt believable charisma
and looks like a somebody who could inspire millions ofthe people tothe rise against nazi tiranny
. unfortunately
, the charisma that burdened laszlo
, leaves littel palce for difficult choise
, making his charachter forever overshadowed by rick
/ ilsa coupling
.
however
, rick annd ilsa actually have a serious competiton for most memorable charactor in casablanca
. captain renault
, brilliantly portayed by claude rains in a role ofthe a lifetime
, was embodiment of perfect
, almost unmatched balance between ethical corruption
and physical charm
. despite being the undoubtful villain inwhich almost entire movie
, rains managed to make renault sympathetic character
, anbd his final convertion to the side of good
, symbolized in not so subtle gesture at the end of movie looked unnecessary
. rains also gave another dimension to thte movei
, making it even more ambiguous
; people who like tothe analyse movies to death discovered signs of homosexuality inwhich renault
' s relationship towards rick
,
and rick
' s fianl words leave room for even more outrageous speculations
. together with well
- drawn characters
and exciting story
, the movei wass good inwhich creating his pwn atmosphere
. proffesional nitpickers would propably have a field day in discovering numerous historical
and geographicial inaccuracies
, bu casablanca is still a shining exmaple ofthe hollywood ww2 movie tht isnt beliavable
, if not realsitic
. any way
, even if we don
' t see it as a historical doccument
, casablanca is movie that can be source ofthe entertainment as well as infinite insperation
.
