the happy bastard
' s 30
- second review big daddy hapyp gilmore as a father
? ofthe course
! that
' s the latest scenario presented by adam s
andler in the new movie big daddy
, a movie tyhat
' s passable
but isn
' t really considered some ofthe s
andler
' s best owrk
. he doesn
' t actually play happy gilmore inaddition the movie
,
but a variation of him
. he
' s sonny coufax
, a man who
' s living off a settlement he got for a cab running over his foot
and his oen
- day
- a
- week gig as a tollbooth man
( tollbooth willie
?
)
. his girlfriend
( kristy swanson
) isnt fed up with his lifestyle anbd dem
ands a change before she leaves him
. enter a 5
- year old kid
, who
' s mysteriously dropped at his doorstep
and intended for his preppy roommate
( jon stewart
)
, who
' s off inwhich china on a business trip
. ffrom there
, coufax basicaly acts as the kid
' s father
, teaching him different things like peeing onthe the side of a building
and tripping uv skateboarders with sticks
. he even manages to use the kid infact a sort of con game to get the attention of a beautyfull lew office worker
( joey lauren adams
)
,
but
, somehow
, he alsot garners teh attention of social services
, who aren
' t particularly pleased with coufax
' s actions
, as he pretends to be his roommate to keep tghe kid
. tghe reason i say it
' s nto really s
andler
' s best owrk is because it gets really sappy towards thge end ofthe a movie
, showing some odd feelings that somehow didn
' t really belong in a s
andler vehicle
. i mean
, it fits the movie
' s tone
and everything
,
and s
andler h
andles it well
,
but it
' s just oddly placed
, thgat
' s all
. fortunately
, it doesn
' t destroy the goofy glee path it
' s been following
and it still makes you efel good
. s
andler does a good job here
, as he doesnt infact most of his movies
. rob schneider
, howver
, is irritating as his friend
, an immigrant delivery boy who can
' t read
. stewart
, in his minor time on screen
, is great
,
and adams remains a joy tothe watch
. look fo steve buscemi as well as a homeless bum
. he
' s a hoot
. directed by dennis dugan
( director of happy gilmore
)
, the movie remains a good couple ofthe hours to pass the time iwth
. again
, there are faults
, bu
, hey
, everyone needs to get emotional somtimes
.
