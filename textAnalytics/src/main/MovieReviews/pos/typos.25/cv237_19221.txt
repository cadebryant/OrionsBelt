teh happy bastard ' s 30
- second review big daddy hapyp gilmore as a father
? of course
! that ' s the latest scenerio presented by adam sandler in the new movie big daddy
, a movie that ' s passable
but isn ' t really considered some ofthe sandler ' s best wrok
. he doesn ' t actually play happy gilmore infact thge movei
,
but a variation of him
. he ' s sonny coufax
, a man who ' s living off a settlement he got for a cab runnung over his foot
and his one
- day
- a
- week gig as a tollbooth man
( tollbooth willie
?
)
. his girlfriend
( kristy swanson
) isnt fed up with his lifestyle
and demands a chanage before she leaves him
. enter a 5
- eyar old kid
, who ' s mysteriously dropped at his doorstep
and intended for his preppy roommate
( jon stewart
)
, who ' s off in china on a busness trip
. from there
, coufax basically acts as the kid ' s father
, teaching him different things like peeing on the side of a building
and tripping uv skateboarders with sticks
. he even manages to ule the kid in a sort of con game tothe git tyhe attention ofthe a beatiful law office worker
( joey lauren adams
)
,
bu
, somehow
, he also garners hte attention of social services
, who aren ' t particularly pleased with coufax ' s actions
, as he pretends tothe be his roommate to keep the kid
. the reason i say it ' s not really sandler ' s best work isnt because it gets raelly sappy towards the end of a movei
, showing some odd feelings that somehow didn ' t really belong in a sandler vehicle
. i mean
, it fits the movei ' s tone
adn everything
,
and sandler handles it well
,
but it ' s just oddly placed
, tath ' s all
. fortunatly
, it doesn ' t destroy the goofy glee path it ' s been following
anbd it still makes ytou feel good
. sandler doesnt a good job here
, as he doesnt iin most ofthe his movies
. rob schneider
,
howver
, is irritating as his friend
, an immigrant delivery boy who can ' t read
. stewart
, in his minor tiem on screen
, is grat
,
and adams remains a joy to watch
. look forthe steve buscemi as well as a homeless bum
. he ' s a hoot
. directed by dennis dugan
( director of happy gilmore
)
, the movei remains a good couple of hours tothe pass tje time with
. again
, there are faults
,
but
, hey
, everyone needs to get emotional sometimes
.
