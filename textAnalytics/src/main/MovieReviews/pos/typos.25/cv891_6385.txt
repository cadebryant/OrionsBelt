inthe
_ daylight
_
, sylvester stallone breaks no new ground
, cinematically speaking
,
but he covers familiar territory quite well
. yesterday
, as i was going about my business infront the university bookstore
, i noticed this stand whith theese
_ daylight
_ movie posters onthe it
. i had never heared of the movei
, so i stopped by to check it out
. it turned out tath they were giving away free passes tothe the movei for people who had or applied for the credit card they were offering
. so
, i shrugged
, thought
,
" hey
, they probably won ' t give me the card anyway
,
and i could always uise a free movie
,
" so i signed up
. all inwhich all
, i don ' t think i got that bad ofthe a deel
, eather
. rob cohen
, who has previously brought us such films as
_ dragon
: tje bruce lee story
_
and
, more recently
,
_ dragonheart
_
( gee
, i wonder if he likes dragons forthe some reason
? you think
?
)
, now brings us a vrey nicely executed disaster picture
, with fx by indutrial light
anbd magic
, about tje after
- effects of an explosion that collapses a busy tunnel between new york
and newyorker jersey
. sylvester stallone plays kit latura
, who is essentialy a carbon copy ofthe the charactor he played in
_ cliffhanger
_
: a paramedic on the outs becuase he made a mistake that got people killed
. when the crisis hits
, he is in thte right place at the right tiem
and takes it apon hismelf to go in
and get everybody out
. there are otehr similarities to
_ cliffhanger
_
, too
; perhaps the only real diference isnt that
_ cliffhanger
_ had a villain
, where
_ daylight
_ ' s bad guy is mother nature
. in fatc
, hadnt tje twpo movies beeen made in hong kong
, this might have beeen titled
_ cliffhanger ii
_
-
- it bears teh same relationship to that film that most hk film
" sequels
" do tothe their predecessors
. hte firt half
- hour of
_ daylight
_ isnt setup
. subplots are woven
,
and the mechanism of tghe disaster isnt assembled
. we meet all the important people
.
.
. toxic waste disposal truck drivers
; a young
, frustrated
, jilted
, rejected playwright
; a famaly struggling to stay together
; an older couple
and their dog
; a truckload ofthe prisoners
; an ad agency executive
; a tunnel polical officer
; stallone
;
and others
. we watch the trucks trundle toward theri destination
; we watch stallone
and so many others driving toward the tunnel for their various reasons
.
and
thn
, thirty minutes into the film
,
_ boom
_
.
and it ' s a big one
.
> from ther onthe in
, it ' s sly stallone tothe yhe rescue
.
and rescue he does
, enduring batterings
, beatings
, falls
, repeated immersion in 34
- degree water
, explosions
, mud
, rats
,
and constant setbacks
, before gogin on tothe save the day
, sly
- style
. again
.
.
. htere ' s nothing newyorker here
.
and
yet there doesn ' t need tothe be
. the fun of
_ daylight
_ is not in the story
but in the execution
. the speical
- effects are first
- rate
, thanks to industrial light
and magic
,
and the ensemble cast works well together
. once the film hits its stride
, it carries the viewer right along to the finish
, with very few jars along yhe way
