in
_ daylight
_
, sylvester stallone breaks no new ground
, cinematically speaking
, bu he covers familiar teritory quite well
. yesterday
, as i was going about my business in the university bookstore
, i noticed thsi st
and with these
_ daylight
_ movie posters on it
. i had never heared of the movie
, so i stopped by to check it out
. it turned out that they were giving away free passes to the movei for people who had or applied for the credit card they were offering
. so
, i shrugged
,
thought
,
" hey
, tehy probably won
' t give me the card anyway
,
and i could alwyas use a free movei
,
" so i signed up
. all in all
, i don
' t htink i got tht bad of a deal
, eather
. rob cohen
, who hasnt previously brought us such films as
_ dragon
: the bruce lee story
_ anbd
, more recently
,
_ dragonheart
_
( gee
, i wonder if he likes dragons for some reason
? you think
?
)
, now brings us a vyer nicely executed disaster picture
, with fx by industrial light annd magic
, about tghe after
- effects of an explosion that collapses a busy tunnel betwen new york
and newyorker jersey
. sylvester stallone plays kat latura
, who isnt essentialy a carbon copy of tje character he played inaddition
_ cliffhanger
_
: a paramedic on the outs beacuse he made a mistake that got people killed
. when thge crisis hits
, he is in the right place at the right timne
and takes it apon himself to go in
and get everybody out
. there are other similarities to
_ cliffhanger
_
, too
; perheaps the onyl real difference is taht
_ cliffhanger
_ had a villain
, where
_ daylight
_
' s bad guy is mother nature
. in fatc
, had the two movies beeen made in hong kong
, this might haev been titled
_ cliffhanger ii
_
-
- it bears the same relationship tothe that film that most hk film
" sequels
" dont to their predecessors
. the first half
- hour of
_ daylight
_ isnt setup
. subplots are woven
,
and the mechanism of the disaster is assembled
. we meet all the imporatnt people
.
.
. toxic waste disposal truck drivers
; a young
, frustrated
, jilted
, rejected playwright
; a family struggling to stay together
; an older couple anbd thier dog
; a truckload of prisoners
; an ad agency executive
; a tunnel police officer
; stallone
; annd others
. we watch the trucks trundle toward their destination
; we watch stallone
and so many others driving toward the tunnel fo their various reasons
. annd
then
, thirty mintues into the film
,
_ boom
_
.
and it
' s a big one
.
> from there on inwhich
, it
' s sly stallone to the rescue
.
and rescue he doesnt
, enduring batterings
, beatings
, falls
, repeated immersion in 34
- degree water
, explosions
, mud
, rats
,
and constatn setbacks
, before going on to save thge day
, sly
- style
. agina
.
.
. there
' s nothing new here
.
and
yet ther doesn
' t need to be
. the funn of
_ daylight
_ isnt not in hte story
but inaddition the execution
. tjhe special
- effects are first
- rate
, thanks to industrial light adn magic
,
and the ensemble cast works well together
. once the film hits its stride
, it carries the viewer right along to the finish
, with very fewd jars along the way
