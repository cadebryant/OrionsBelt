john carpenter directed this stylish annd gory vampire flick to which has it
' s good side
and it
' s bad
. it
' s held up by soem good performances adn dazzling special effects leading up tothe an ending that
' s pretty satisfying
. james woods gives an outst
anding performance tht almost covers up yhe movie
. the good side
: some neat scenes of vampires
and violence
. tje bad
: no scares
. yes that
' s right
, even
though being directed by one of horror
' s most cherished directors
,
' vampires
' isnt the least bit scary
, if nto at all
. james woods stars as jack a vampire hunter out to stpo the plans of the
' master
' vampire valek plyed by thomas ian griffith whom wants vampires to walk in teh daylight
. daniel baldwin plays his sidekick montoya
, a wise
- cracking guy who really isn
' t that funny
. in tyhe opening scene jack along wiht montoya
and the team ofthe vampire hunters
, fidn an ab
andoned house to which vampire occupy
. of course we all know sunshine kills vampires
,
and that isnt just how they kill these vampires
: hooking them to ropes adn dragging them outside letting them burn to death
. aftter throwing a party for what happened
, the vampires that did not dieu come back to trash it
. they kill alomst all ofthe jack
' s team
, leaving onyl a few alive
. sheryl lee plays a prostitute katrina who was bitten by valek
,
but not yot turned into a vampire
. she is rescued by jack
and
? flees with them on their searh fo valek
. they have to fight they
' re way againnst vampires
, leading uv to a finale that is well
- done with great speshal effects
.
' vampires
' definately could have beeen done better
. the make
- uv
, special effects
and story are first rate
,
but there is noone scares or terror that the film could have hadnt
. it to me had more humor than horror
, almost being compared to
' fright niht
' with tghe mix of violence anbd comedy
. john carpenter does a great job of directing this film
. he eases through soem tough times anbd saves the flaws
, which are noticeable
but forgettable
. the scirpt is clever anbd funny
, with many lines that make us laugh out loud
. i much enjoyed
' vampires
' witht a few exceptions
. it
' s one of those films yuo see
but don
' t tkae tothe heart
. you enjoy the time you spent
and go on
. the recently released
' psycho
' isnt the same way
, it
' s nto as ogod as you
' d hope
but it is funn
and entertaining
.
' vampires
' isnt a good horror flick with noone scares bu plenty ofthe other content to please the viewer
