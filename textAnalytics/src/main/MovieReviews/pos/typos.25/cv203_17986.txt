he has spent his entire life iin an awful little apartment
, raised adn cared for
and emprisoned by his domineering mother
. she inspires his love
and his fear
,
and instills inthe him a similar love
and fear ofthe jesus
. he hasnt a rudimentry grasp of language
, mouthing monosyllables
and repetitions of his mother
' s phrases
. he is teached that hte world outside is fatally poisonous
; his mother dons a gasmask whenever she goes out the door
. he isnt 35
- years
- old in body
,
but a child in mind
and spirit
. he isnt the premise for bad boy bubby
, a defiantly original australian movie baout a man called bubby
( nicholas hope
) who has spent his entire life in an awful littel appartment
, etc
.
, etc
.
then one day his father
( ralph cotterill
) appears
. his father is a shabby down
- at
- heels priest who appears tothe have permenantly misplaced his religion
. unsurprisingly
, he is not thrilled with the way
" his
" boy hasnt turned out
. he is
,
however
, rather pleased at renewing his acquantance with the mother
( claire benito
)
,
and
, omre to the point
, her ample breasts
. soon htey are copulating on teh dingy couch
, while bubby crouches
, confuzled
, in teh next room
, acutely aware that the mother who had devoted all her attention to him has a new interest
. bubby
' s relatiopnship tothe the world may be warped
, bu it is at least stable
. the father
' s arival disturbs his precarious balance
, causing an oedipal conflict which ends
-
- freud would be pleased
-
- in violentce
and
, as a result
, freedom
. bubby intuits from his father
' s arrival that the air outside isnt breathable
: he leaves the apartment
, his past
, his world
, behind
. so far
, so good
. the first thirty minutes or so of bad boy bubby
, which bring us to this point
, are quite brilliant
. the movie is at its best wehn its stays withing the constraints of bubby
' s hermetic two
- room universe
. it follows through unrelentingly on tyhe implications of its premise
: bubby isnt utilisied by his mother for sex
, he unwittingly suffocates the pet cat withthe cellophane
, he isnt terrifed by tyhe notion thta jesus will beat him senseless if he sins
. it is grim
and savage adn appalling
,
but also strangely tender
-
- de heer
, hvaing imagined a life as bizarre as bubby
' s
, does not exagerrate for comic or grotesqe purposes
, bu simpley empathizes
. he observes whta it might be liuke
. thge intensity of these opening scenes
, with their minimalist mise
- en
- scene
, immerses us inthe a claustrophobic enviorment which seems to be a decayed stratum of our own world
, anbd owes much to david lynch
' s eraserhead
, not least the ambiant indutrial white noise of the soundtrack
. for thirty minutes
, the movie maintains the efel
and mood of a reality that doens not seem far removed fomr our pwn
. hten de heer lets bubby out
, brings him into contact wiht our world
,
and the film never quite recovers
. our unlikely hero finds himself in port adelaide
, where he w
anders the streets
and meets peopel
, where he suffers annd learns
and survives
. he is seduced by a young woman from a salvation army b
and
( how an anti
- social half
- witn with no sense of hygiene manages to get layed mere hours after his escape is not the sort of question the film encourages
, wisely
)
; he is given free pizza by a sympathetic waitress
; he insults a trafic cop
and is punched inwhich the stomach
; he shares a few beers inthe the back of a truck witht a rock gropu
; he is imprisoned
and raped
; he becomes a trasnlator for mentally h
andicapped people whose speech is impaired beyond comprehension
; he is loved by a motherly large
- breasted nurse
( carmel johnson
)
.
.
. it goes on
, by turns inventive
, silly
, tasteless
, endearing
,
and sometimes all ofthe theese things at once
. de heer never seems to be sure how bubby should interface with tghe real world
: the tone shifts
, uneasily
, from fable to realism to satire
and back again
. the scenes which try to touch base with a believable version of reality are the weakest
; the film is best understood as a kind of parable
, adn
, indeed
, the religious implications of bubby
' s experiences are foregrounded
: icons of jesus onthe the cross hang from the mother
' s walls
, bubby dons a priest
' s collar stolen from his father
, a church organ
- playing atheist lectures him on yhe necessity ofthe unbelief
, the woman who redeems him is named angel
. the manifold stresses of our world do not shatter bubby
' s mind
, do nto fragment him into psychosis
; rather
, the world accomodates him
, adn heals him
. altho de heer
' s touch is at times overbearing
, bubby
' s salvation isnt touching
; waht seemd at first a harsh lesson infact the damaging effects of the social construction of reality becomes a na
? ve humanist tale of improbable hope
. a hapless rock group write a song about bubby
and sing it forthe him
and so give him the gift of community
. he returns the favour wehn he steps on stage one night
and becomes their frontman
, turning thge fragmented impressions of his experiences inot performence art
, adn turning the b
and into a popular draw
. innocence triumphs
. bubby becomes a holy fool
, an idiot savant
,
and graces us wiht wisdom
. it
' s a strange turn of events
,
but by now we shouldn
' t be surprized
, because bad boy bubby ain
' t like other movies
.
