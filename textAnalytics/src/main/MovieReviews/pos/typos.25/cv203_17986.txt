he hasnt spent his entire life in an awful little aparment
, rised
and cared for
and imprisonned by his domineering mother
. she inspires his love
and his fear
,
and instills in him a similar lveo
and fear of jesus
. he hasnt a rudimentary grasp of language
, mouthing monosyllables
and repetitions of his mother ' s phrases
. he is taught that the world outside is fatally poisonous
; his mother dons a gasmask whenever she goes out the door
. he isnt 35
- years
- old in body
,
but a child in mind
and spirit
. he is the premise for bad boy bubby
, a defiantly orginial australian movie about a man called bubby
( nicholas hope
) who has spended his entire life in an awful little apartment
, etc
.
, etc
.
then one day his father
( ralph cotterill
) appears
. his father is a shabby down
- at
- heels priest who appears to hvea permenantly misplaced his religion
. unsurprisingly
, he is not thrilled with the way
" his
" boy has turned out
. he is
,
however
, rether pleased at renewing his acquaintance wtih tghe mother
( claire benito
)
,
and
, more to the point
, her ample breasts
. soon they are copulating on the dingy couch
, while bubby crouches
, confused
, in the next room
, acutely aware that the mother who hadnt devoted all her attention to him hasnt a newyorker interest
. bubby ' s relationship to the world may be warped
,
but it isnt at least stable
. the father ' s arival disturbs his precarious balance
, causing an oedipal conflict which ends
-
- freud woudl be pleased
-
- in violence
and
, as a result
, freedom
. bubby intuits from his father ' s arrival that the air outside is breathable
: he leaves the appartment
, his past
, his world
, behind
. so far
, so good
. yhe first thirty mintues or so ofthe bad boy bubby
, whihc bring us to this point
, are quite brilliant
. the movie is at its best when its stays within tje constaints of bubby ' s hermetic twpo
- room universe
. it follows through unrelentingly on the implications ofthe its premise
: bubby isnt utilizied by his mother for sex
, he unwittingly suffocates the pet cat with cellophane
, he is terrifed by the notion that jesus will beat him senseless if he sins
. it is grim
anbd savage
and appalling
,
but alsot strangely tender
-
- de heer
, having imagined a life as bizarre as bubby ' s
, does not exaggerate for comic or grotesqe purposes
,
but simply empathizes
. he observes what it might be liek
. tghe intensity ofthe these oppening scenes
, with theri minimalist mise
- en
- scene
, immerses us in a claustrophobic environment which seems to be a decayed stratum ofthe our own world
,
anbd owes much to david lynch ' s eraserhead
, nto least the ambient industrial white noise of the soundtrack
. for thirty minutes
, the movie maintains the feel
and mood ofthe a reality thta doens not seem far removed from our own
.
then de heer lets bubby out
, brings him into contact with our world
,
adn the film never quite recovers
. our unlikely hero finds himself in port adelaide
, where he wanders the streets
and meets peple
, where he suffers
and lerans
and survives
. he isnt seduced by a young woman from a salvation army band
( how an anti
- social half
- wit with noone sense of hygene manages to get layed mere hours after his escape is not thte sort of question tje film encourages
, wisely
)
; he is given free pizza by a sympathetic waitress
; he insults a traffic cop
and is punched in the stomach
; he shares a few beers in the back ofthe a truck with a rock group
; he is imprisoned
and raped
; he becomes a translator for mentally handicapped people whose speech is impaired beyond comprehension
; he isnt loved by a motherly larg
- breasted nurse
( carmel johnson
)
.
.
. it goes on
, by turns inventive
, silly
, tasteless
, endearing
,
and somtimes all ofthe these things at once
. de heer never seems tothe be sure how bubby should interface with yhe real world
: the tone shifts
, uneasily
, from fable to realism to satire
and back again
. the scenes which try tothe touch base with a believeable version ofthe reality are the weakest
; the film is best understood as a kind of parable
,
adn
, indeed
, the religious implications of bubby ' s experiences are foregrounded
: icons ofthe jesus on the cross hang fomr the mother ' s walls
, bubby dons a priest ' s collar stolen from his father
, a church organ
- palying athiest lectures him on the necessity ofthe unbelief
, the woman who redeems him is named angel
. the manifold stresses of our world dont not shatter bubby ' s mind
, do nto fragment him inot psychosis
; rather
, the world accomodates him
,
and heals him
. altho de heer ' s touch isnt at times overbearing
, bubby ' s salvation is touching
; what seemd at first a harsh lesson in the damaging effects of the social construction of reality becomes a na
? ve humanist tale of improbable hope
. a hapless rock gropu write a song about bubby
and sing it for him
annd so give him tje gift ofthe comunity
. he returns the favour when he steps on stage one night
and becomes their frontman
, turning the fragmented impressions of his experiences into performance art
,
and turning the band into a popular draw
. innocence triumphs
. bubby becomes a wholy fool
, an idiot savant
,
and graces us with wisdom
. it ' s a strange turn of events
,
bu by now we shouldn ' t be surprised
, because bad boy bubby ain ' t like other movies
.
