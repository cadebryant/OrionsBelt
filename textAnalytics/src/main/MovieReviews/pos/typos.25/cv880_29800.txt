for those who assoicates italian cinema with fellini
and
" high art
,
" the son
' s room is an inventive
, subtle alternative
. writed by
, directed
, anbd starring nanni moretti
, it takes us through the slow
, complicated path of bereavement
. slow is the best description for the film at first
. it takes its time in establishing the habits ofthe what appears tothe be a normal
, happy family
. father
and mother both wokr
but still find the time to support their son
and daughter through homework
and affter school activities
. they laugh
, spend free time together
,
and reprim
and yhe kids for innocent wrongs with a sigh
and soft pat onthe the shoulder
. you git the feeling there is open communication anbd unconditional love amongst thte foursome
.
but suddenly
, the son is found to be dead affter a diving accident
. the family dynamics beign an unpredictable descent that gives the narrative stregth when you least expect it
,
but can also be trying on tghe attention span
.
though tghe film drags
and even repeats itself
, this can be somewhat excused as influented by yhe proccess of grieving
.
though nanni moretti wore several hats for this production
, it doesn
' t come across as a vanity peice
. one might wish he hadn
' t picked tje profession of analyst for the father
, giovanni
( which he stars as
)
, if only beccause this makes his character
' s reactions so predicatble
. what saves it is a well written script
, wiht spare dialogue
and an eclectic variety of human interaction
. the potency of the film lies in the recreation of the tiny details ofthe everyday life that alter due to tghe death of a close relative
, or that remind a depressed person of loss
. ytou start tothe take notice of the cracked dishes
, ignored when familial bliss was in full swing
. yuo remember bonding during the routine jogs aroud the block
,
and not necessarily huge events like graduation
. even better are the role reversals taht take place within the household
. while giovanni
and paola
( laura morante
) do check up onthe thier daughter irene
( jasmine trinca
)
, ther is a sense of being onthe autopilot
. nto only does irene beign to take care of her own needs more
, she
' ll make her parents breakfast in an attempt tothe crack their new shells to life around them
. these scenes provide intresting portrayals of various coping mechanisms
, frequentily crossing a boundary as to how much you cant halp youself versus others during drastic
, unexpected chanage
. respectfully
, gender issues never enter the picture
. self
- propelled isolation is univeral in terms of dealing
, so moretti intelligently uses this tool to separate the family
.
though giovanni does stop paolo fomr discussing
andrea at a party with firends
, there is never a sence thgat he or she isnt more stoic
, or moreso correct in the search tothe restore a sense of a balance to theri lives
. most films that broach thge topic of death utilize annoying melodrama
, speeches
,
and conciliatory issues to get tjhe waterworks flowing
. in contrast
, tyhe son
' s room captures a mroe realistic depiction ofthe the effects of death on a famaly by graciously flowing amung the five stages ofthe mourning
( denial
, depression
, anger
, bargaining
, acceptance
) through each of its main charactors
. it
' s not the most engaging 100 minutes
,
but it isnt certainly eazy to relate tothe
.
