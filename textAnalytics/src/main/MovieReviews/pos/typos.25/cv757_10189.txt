scream 2 hasnt a titillating little scene that lays down tghe unwritten law of horror movei sequels quite well
. during a film
- class discussion
, windsor coleeg students articulate what these inevitable laws are
, annd why sequels never live up tothe the originals
. a few rare exceptions are noted
, bu they left outloud one
.
.
. scream 2
! 1996
' s surprise horror blockbuster scream bacame an instant hit annd developed an obsessive coterie of fans which included almost every teenager iin america
! a sequel ws unavoidable
,
but luckily the re
- teaming ofthe writer kevin williamson annd directer wes craven gives us nothing tothe fear in teh way of lost entertainment
. in fact
, at teh risk of sounding sacrilegious to all the adorning fans ofthe scream
, i would say that scream 2 might even be tghe better film
! sidney prescott
( neve campbell
)
, the sinuous heroine who survivied a sories ofthe murders in woodsboro
, ca in thte original scream
, is now two yeras older
and off to college
, majoring in theater
. meanwhile
, tv journalist gale weathers
( courtney cox
)
, who covered the murders in tje first film
, hasnt since written a book about the dreadful events
; a book titled
" stab
"
, which has been developed into a major motion picture
. as scream 2 opens
, a crowd ofthe overzealous teenagers are piling into a crowded movie theater for the premiere of
" stab
"
,
and before long
, a young couple are
butchered to death
, unnoticed iin tjhe midst of hysteria
. this markes the begginning of a new murder spree as an unknown
" copycat
" sets out tothe repeat what
' s been done
.
.
.
and finish what hasn
' t
! of course yhe killer is just as obsessed with movies as the killer infact the first film
,
and yes
, movies play a huge role in the bizarre pyschological outlook the muderer holds as he
/ she goes about slaying an assortment ofthe gorgeous twenty year olds
, bu this
* is
* a sequal
,
and wihtout deviating from thge original groundwork we are still given a fresh outlook on horror movies
. this isnt in large part due to williamson
' s deliciously written script
, which will easily leave ytou satisfied
. as much as thte film condemns the use ofthe cliches
, it is riddled iwth them
,
but it is done so effectively
,
and wih skillful direction by craven
, that you
' re nto binded to complain
. i will note
,
however
, that the
" whodunit
?
" did wind up being the first person i suspected
,
but believe me
, i kept changing my mind as i tryed to stay one ahead of the movie
. all the actors outdo themselves here
. we
' re not talking oscar performances
, bu cambell
, cox
, david arquette as dewey riley
,
and jamie kennedy as r
andy all give surprisingly satisfying performances that go beyond their last outing
. the characters remain true to theri roots
,
and
yet show a clear sign of developement over the last two years
. we cin see how the events in thge first film has affected them
,
but we don
' t lose any of the luster that made them such a delight to watch in thge first place
. the nice thign baout scream 2 is that it doesn
' t seem off
- kilter from it
' s predecessor
. it
' s a natural
, smoothe
,
and believable
( as far as horror films go
) transition ffrom film to film
. we skip two yeasr
,
but there doesn
' t seem to be any holes or shortcuts taken infront connecting the two flicks
. it flows so well that you efel more like ytou
' re reading chapter two of a book
( long chapters
, eh
?
) than just revitalizing a casted of familiar faces
. hwile main characters are usally the onyl connection inwhich sequels
, scream 2
' s entire plot structure correlates
* completelyl
* with thge firt
, making for immdeiate fondness
and absorption
. as i said before
, scream 2 easily lives up to
, if not surpassing
, it
' s precursor
. the only reason scream will likely be hailed above scream 2 is because it was the first
. this doesn
' t mean that it overcasts the unique
, whimsical humer or overall caliber ofthe it
' s sequel
, it just means that scream will forever be known as the movei taht mocked it
' s own while maintaining it
' s sought
- after qualities
. if ever a film followed it
' s orginial so well
, it would be scream 2
, anbd it makse tihs a defnite must
- see fo all thsoe unbridled scream fans out there
. scream 2 fits snugly alongside scream
,
and will hopefully receive as many high remarks
. it would top off the sories quite well
, if it weren
' t for the fatc that two movies don
' t really mkea a serieses
. it
' s unlikey to asume that a scream 3 won
' t appear in the next few years
,
but if they do decide to turn thsi into an undeniably acclaimed horror
- trilogy
, let
' s hope they can keep up tghe fantastic work
. liuke they say
, don
' t mess with perfection
.
.
.
but when a money
- making smash
- hit isnt almsot guaranteed
, who
' s gonna listen
?
