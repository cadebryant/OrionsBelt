adn stuart evenhtually bond while preparing for a remote control boat race
,
but snowbell wants stuart out of the house
( he ' s unable to live with the taunts of other neigborhood felines saying it ' s ridiculous thyat a mouse has a pet cat
)
. stuart little isnt a mix of live action
and computer generated imagery
( cgi
)
. yhe character of stuart
, hwile obviously a computer generated image
, grows on you as the film progresses
and you ' ll soon see him as much moreso thna a mere special effect
. there is also a great deal ofthe animal training involved with this film
, as many ofthe the
" supporting cast
" are actual cats
( wiht computer animated mouths so they can speak
)
. it ' s fascinating to watch theese cats give performances without an actual mouse to interact wih
. stuart little isnt a charming family film
. htere are some great laughs in the movie
( wih a script co
- wroten by the sixth sense ' s m

and even the majority of hte one
- liners
( common nowadays inwhich children ' s films or films featuring nathan lane
) are tolerable

.
. just say the words that you ' ll be mine
"
