( voiced by nathan lane
)
. george adn stuart eventually bond while preparing for a remote control boat race
,
but snowbell whants stuart out of the hous
( he
' s unable to live with the taunts of other neighborhood felines saying it
' s ridiculous tath a mouse has a pet cat
)
. stuart little is a mix ofthe live action
and computer generated imagery
( cgi
)
. the character ofthe stuart
, while obviously a computer generated image
, grows on you as the film progresses annd you
' ll soon see him as much more than a mere speical effect
. htere isnt also a great deel of animal training involved with this film
, as many ofthe the
" supporting cast
" are actual cats
( with computer animated mouths so they cxan speak
)
. it
' s fascinating to watch these cats give performances without an actuall mouse tothe interact wih
. stuart little is a charming family film
. ther are soem great laughs in tghe movie
( wih a scirpt co
- writen by the sixth sence
' s m

, some moments that can onyl be described as
" too cute
"
( the boat race sequence is what won me over
)
and even the majority ofthe the oen
- liners
( common nowadays in childrens
' s films or films featuring nathan lane
) are tolerable

.
. just say hte words taht you
' ll be mine
"
. um
