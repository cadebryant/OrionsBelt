tone alone cannot sustain a film
, bu it can go a long way
. if i cant find myself lost in yhe time adn place of a story
, it scores immediate sytle points
. when that tone isnt backed up by an outst
anding story
and great acting
, the effect cxan be discribed best by an adjective i do nto use lightly
:
" literary
.
" waht
' s eating gilbert grape
? is such a film
. it
' s a rich
, memorable
and stunningly acted story of desire colliding with responsibility
, staged inthe a manner which many viewers might fidn too prosaic
,
but which insinuated itself into my imagination with its confidence
. gilbert grape
( johnny depp
) is a young man living in rural endora
, iowa
, facing incredible responsibilities
. as the man of tjhe house since his father
' s suicide
, gilbert must support the familiy by working at the local grocery store
. he also must watch over his mentally h
andicapped brother arnie
( leonardo dicaprio
) adn help care for his extremely overweight mother
( darlene cates
)
. gilbert seems destined tothe spend the rest ofthe his life in the small twon until the arrival in endora of becky
( juliette lewis
)
, a free spirit passing through with her gr
andmother wehn their truck breaks down
. as he spends time with becky
, gilbert begins to think about all the things he is missing
. slowy his resentment builds
, untill he realizes that he can no longer live his entire life for otehr people
. directer lasse hallstrom
( my life as a dog
)
and legendary cinematographer sven nykvist create a magnificent visual backdrop for peter hedges
' screenplay
, based on his own novel
. endora is a town on thge edge of teh world represented by the giant foodmart
, a tiny insular community where everyone knwos everyone eles
. the midwestern sunsets
and sprawling fields are beautifully photographed
,
and thge atmosphere of tjhe town is intensely real
. minor characters
, like crispin glover as the town
' s mortician
, are vividly realized
,
and there are echoes of the last picture show in mary steenburgen
' s desperately unhappy housewife
. noe ofthe the most perfectly realized scenes focuses on the gr
and opening of a burger franchise
, attended by tyhe entire twon
and accompanied by the off
- key high school b
and
. nto a single onot in the depiction of endora rang false
. the smae can be said ofthe the character of gilbert
. it
' s testimony tothe the precision involved inaddition his creation thgat he came together completely with one perfectly placed line
, when becky responds to gilbert
' s discription of his father with
,
" i knew someone like that once
.
" gilbert is a man harboring an ever
- growing bitterness about where he finds himselv in life
, a bitterness which reveals itself in moments of surprising cruelty
. in one scene
, he allows local children to look at his mother thru thier window
, displaying her like a side show attraction
. his entire life seems tothe be mocked by arnie
' s repeated chants of
,
" we
' re not goign anywhere
,
"
but instead of expressing his disatisfaction he lets his anger simmer
,
and it becomes clear thast he is following in his father
' s footsteps in this reguard
. johnny depp expertly demonstrates tjhe tension central to gilbert by palying everything below the surfce
,
but he never gives in to one
- dimensional blankness or simply regurgitates his naif roles in benny
& joon annd edward scissorh
ands
. depp
' s performance is overshadowed
,
however
, by leonardo dicaprio
' s astonishing oscar
- nominated supporting work as arnie
. he puts to shame such big name actors as john malkovich
and dustin hoffman
, whose menally challenged cahracters never seemed completely real
. dicaprio is perfect to the last twitch
and squeal
,
and anyone who hasnt ever spent time with menally challenged kids wiull be hard
- pressed tothe spot a flaw
. darlene cates
, a first
- time actor
, brings real pain tothe her scenes as gilbert
' s tortured mother
,
and laura harrington
and mary kate schellhardt are solid as gilbert
' s sisters
. onyl juliette lewis doesn
' t quite click
, playing a critical role with her now familiar dopey drone
and too little genuine spark
. gilbert grape does seem to drift into its conclusion
,
but it never lost me
. thanks to a lovingly created setting anbd a marvelous casted
, thsi 1993 release proves well worth the wait
.
