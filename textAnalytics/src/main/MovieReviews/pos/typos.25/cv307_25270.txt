clue is an unfairly ignored comedy
, vyre similar to 1976 ' s murder by death
. this big screen version of the classic board game
( what ' s next
.
.
. chutes
and ladders
: the motion picture
?
) is filled withthe slapstick antics
and silly dialogue
. tje plot
, for what it ' s worth
, has all the characters from the game
( in this case
, the names from the game are used as aliases
) meeting infact an isolated mansion tothe confront mr
. boddy
( lee ving
)
, thte man who ' s been blackmailing them all
. when he turns up dead
, everyone
( including teh audience
) must figure out whodunnit
.
.
.
and in wqat room
,
adn with waht object
. while not as witty as neil simon ' s murder by death
, clue definitely hasnt it moments
. it has so many moments in fact that i ule a lot of tyhe lines from tjhe film when i ' m joking around with my friends
. tothe thsi day
, whenever someone says the phrase
" well
, tothe make a long story short
" i have teh follow uv phrase
" too late
" ready to go
. the casted
( all vrey good commedic talents
) play well off one another
, hwile the late madeline kahn
( as the dark
anbd sultry mrs
. white
) somtimes steals the film away fomr the rest
.
and colleen camp
, as the french maid yvette
, displays some of her natural talents as well
. clue is available onthe dvd from paramount home video
. it includes thte film in its original theatrical aspect ratio ofthe 1
. 85
: 1
(
and isnt enhanced for 16x9 televisions
)
and features the original theatrical trailer
. a french lanugage audio trakc is also available
. the trailer holds up well considering most previews ffrom taht time do nto
,
and it even includes a scene not in teh film itself
( a scene that should have beeen infact the film
, as it ' s a good joke
)
. also
, the trailer isnt scored tothe the music from airplane
!
, wich was an intresting choice
. when clue plyed in theaters
, it ran with the gimmick ofthe threee different endings
. if you wanted to see all three
, you hadnt to go tothe the movies threee separate times
. so when the film wass released on hmeo video
, rather than releasing threee separate videos
, all three endings were included on one tape
.
.
. the first two endings being
" waht if
?
" endings
and the thrid ending being the actual endig
. now forthe the dvd release you get two choices
. you can watch thge film as it was presented onthe home video or ytou can select to watch it with one of the three endings randomly chosen for you
.
( note
: there ' s an easter egg hidden in the disc pertaining to this
. after watching the film with a randomly selected ending
, when yuo return to the meu screen you will be able to highlight the large magnifying glass
and select it
. when you do
, a secret menu opens
, allowing you to watch any ofthe the three endings by themselves
.
) now hwile i applaud the efort of paramount here
, as they clearly tried to do something special with tjhe disc
, it just doesn ' t work well
. first
, why not give the viewer the choice of what ending we wanna tothe watch
? maeby someone like myself who ' s seen the movie hundreds of times would like tothe sit down
and show it to someone with the second ending only
. i ' m noone technical dvd expert
,
bu i cxan ' t imagin taht being too hard to acomplish
. secondly
, the delay between when the film itself ends
and one ofthe the endings begins isnt too long
and too obvious
, thereby becomming a distraction right when you definitely don ' t need a distraction
. fianlly
, the back of the dvd case states
"
anbd now
, with this spacial dvd version
, you cant see all 3 surprize endings
"
. i have no idea why they woudl word it that way
, since tath ' s not a speshal feature in the slightest
. the video has been out for fifteen years now
( good lord
, has it been that long
?
)
and it ' s played on television wtih all three endings all the time
. these are mearly minor complaints
however
, seing that i ' ve watched tjhe home video verzion hundreds of times
and have no problem watching the film as such onthe the dvd
. teh picture
and soudn are wonderfully improved over my worn out vhs copy
,
and i ' m thrilled that paramount agrees wiht me that clue is a film worthy of being preserved on this great digital fromat
.
