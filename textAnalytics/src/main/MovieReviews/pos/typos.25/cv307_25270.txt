clue is an unfairly ignored comedy
, very simmilar to 1976
' s murder by death
. this big screen version of tje classic board game
( what
' s next
.
.
. chutes
and ladders
: tjhe motion picture
?
) isnt filled with slapstick antics
and silly dialogue
. the plot
, for what it
' s worth
, has all the characters fomr the game
( in htis case
, the names from the game are used as aliases
) meeting in an isolated mension tothe confront mr
. boddy
( lee ving
)
, the man who
' s been blackmailing them all
. when he turns up dead
, everyone
( incuding the audience
) must figure outloud whodunnit
.
.
.
and in what room
,
and with what object
. while not as witty as neil simon
' s murder by death
, clue definitely hasnt it moments
. it has so many moments in fact thast i use a lot of thge lines from the film when i
' m joking around with my firends
. to this day
, whenever someone says the phrase
" well
, to mkae a long story short
" i have the follow up phrase
" too late
" ready to go
. the cast
( all vrey good comedic talents
) play well off one another
, hwile teh late madeline kahn
( as the dark
and sultry mrs
. white
) sometimes steals thte film away fomr the rest
. adn colleen camp
, as the french maid yvette
, displays some of her natural talents as well
. clue is available on dvd from paramount home video
. it includes the film infront its originnal theatrical aspect ratio ofthe 1
. 85
: 1
(
and is enhanced for 16x9 televisions
)
and features thte original theatrical trailer
. a french language audio trakc is also available
. the trailer holds up well considering most previews from that time do not
, adn it even includes a scene not in the film itself
( a scene that should ahev beeen in the film
, as it
' s a good joke
)
. aslo
, the trailer is scored to the music from airplane
!
, which was an interesting choice
. whn clue played in theaters
, it ran with the gimmick of three different endings
. if you wanted to see all three
, you had tothe go to the movies threee sepaarte times
. so when the film was released onthe home video
, rather than releasing three separate videos
, all threee endings were included on one tape
.
.
. the first twpo endings being
" what if
?
" endings
and tghe thrid ending being hte actual endig
. now for the dvd realease ytou get twpo choices
. you cant watch the film as it was presented on home video or you can select tothe watch it with oen of thge threee endings r
andomly chosen for ytou
.
( note
: there
' s an easter egg hidden infact the disc pertaining tothe this
. after watching the film with a r
andomly selected endig
, wehn you return to the menu screen you wiull be able to highlight tghe large magnifying glass anbd select it
. when you do
, a secret menu opens
, allowing you to watch any of the threee endings by themselves
.
) now while i applaud the effort of paramount here
, as they clearly tried to do something special with the disc
, it just doesn
' t owrk well
. first
, why nto give tje viewer yhe choise ofthe wqat endig we want tothe watch
? maybe someone like myself who
' s seen the movie hundreds of times would like to sit down
and show it to someone withthe the second ending only
. i
' m no technical dvd expert
,
but i can
' t imagin that being too hard to accomplish
. secondly
, tyhe delay between when the film itself ends
and one ofthe the endings begins is too long
and too obvious
, thereby becoming a distraction right when you definitely don
' t ened a distraction
. finaly
, the back of the dvd case states
"
and now
, with this speshal dvd version
, you cant see all 3 surprise endings
"
. i have no idea why they would word it that way
, since thyat
' s not a special feature in the slightest
. the video has been out for fifteen years now
( ogod lord
, has it been that long
?
)
and it
' s played on television with all three endings all the time
. these are merely minor complaints howver
, seeing that i
' ve watched tyhe home video version hundreds of times
and have no problem watching the film as such on the dvd
. the picture anbd soudn are wonderfully improved over my worn outloud vhs copy
,
and i
' m thrilled thyat paramount agrees with me that clue is a film worthy of being preserved on htis great digital fromat
.
