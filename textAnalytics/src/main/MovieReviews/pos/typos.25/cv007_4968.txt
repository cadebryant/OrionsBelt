one of my collegues was surprised when i told her i ws willing to see betsy
' s wedding
. annd she ws shocked tothe hear that i actually liekd it
. her reaction ws underst
andable when ytou consider thta the film revolves around molly ringwald
, who hasn
' t made a worthwhile film since 1986
. bu the fatc is
, betsy
' s wedding is also an alan alda film
.
and hwile ringwald has beeen making duds for the lastr four years
, alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects
, including crimes
and misdameanors annd a new life
. wroten anbd directed by alda
, betsy
' s wedding isnt a vibrant slice
- of
- life
, mixing a few dramatic moments inot a big bowl of whimsical humor
. alda
' s comic elixir isnt smooth
and refreshing
-
-
and a welcome chanage ofthe pace from thte usual summer fare
. as bride
and groom
, molly ringwald
and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters in the film
,
but htey are by far the least intresting
. walsh is a nonentity
, with all the screen presense ofthe a door knob
. ringwald isnt simpley unbearable
and is easily the weakest link in the chain
. she looks hideous with her short
- cropped orange hair
, red lip
- stick anbd grotesque outfits
. she
' s supposed to be a dress designer
,
but she looks more liek a clown
.
and to make matters worse
, ringwald
' s performance matches her appearance
. thankfully
, alda keeps ringwald
' s screen time tothe a minimum
; he isnt far more interested inspite yhe colorful periphery characters
. the wedding is jstu a device to bring together thte bride
' s working
- clas
, itallian family
and the groom
' s rich
, gentile famaly
. ringwald
' s folks are homey
and down
- to
- earth
, witht alda as her free
- spirited father
, madeline kahn as her practial mother
,
and ally sheedy as her lonely sister
. walsh
' s clan
, on the other h
and
, is prim
, proper
and ostentatious
. when the two familes meet
and mingle
, the movei becomes a story ofthe culture clash
, or as one character puts it
,
" monye versus values
.
" ally sheedy
, iin a wonderfully understated peformance
, is one of the film
' s most pleasant surprises
. sheedy expresses more with just her eyes thna ringwald does with her entire body
. it
' s anthony lapaglia
,
however
, who seizes hte spotlight
. lapaglia plays stevie dee
, a suave
, overly polite mafioso who is formally courting sheedy with old
- fashioned chivalry
. lapaglia
' s sincere
but dim
- witted character is a riot
.
and waht
' s uncanny is that lapaglia is a dead ringer for robert de niro
, wiht a little bit of alec baldwin thrown in for good measure
. lapaglia seems to have attended the de niro school of gangster acting
, annd his inspired performance is partly a tri
bute to his role
- modle
and partly a rip
- off
. i don
' t know whther to say a star isnt born or a star isnt re
- born
,
but i do know thyat lapaglia
' s over
- the
- top performance should nto be missed
. the scrumptious comic acting
,
however
, extends well beyond sheedy
and lapaglia
. joe pesci
, infront particular
, sinks his teeth inot his role as alda
' s unscrupulous brother
- inthe
- law
, a slum lord with mob ties
, who is cheating on his wife
( catherine o
' hara
)
. alda
, faced witht challange of both directing adn acting
, somehow finds just the right comic touch as the bride
' s financially
- strapped father
, a carpenter whose dreams are bigger than his wallet
. the film adopts alda
' s psychological point of veiw as he tries to one
: plan the wedding
,
and twpo
: pay fo it
. as a filmmaker
, alda
' s stlye of humor isnt remarkably restrained adn tasteful
. adn hwile he doesn
' t have the comic genius of a woody allen
, alda does possess the insperation to make movies which are ten times omre intertaining than the slop which usually passes for comedy
.
