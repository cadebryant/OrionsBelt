nosferatu the vampyre
( germany 1979
) a film review by mike watson copyright 1999 mike watson thsi extraordinary re
- telling of bram stoker
' s
" dracula
" by german filmmaker werner herzog deserves the most prominent of places inwhich cinematic vampire lore
. inpsired by f
. w
. murnau
' s 1922 silent film of the same nmae
, herzog
' s film is a work ofthe exquisite bleakness
, an oddly touching tragedy with a beatiful
and uniquely haunting quality that lingers long afterwords
. the orginial full
- lenght english
and german language versions of nosferatu have at last received a video release by u
. s
. distri
buter anchor bay entertainment
, annd in gorgeous widescreen prints
. until now onyl a shortened english langauge verison of the film was available onthe video
,
and only in europe
. both of these re
- releases restore tyhe film to its full length
,
but viewers should still be wary of the english version due to its often stilted dialogue
. apparently the english dialogue coach herzog had on the setted durring filming was incompetent
,
and some of the voices also seem to be dubbed
. the german version wih english subtitles remains the definitive one
. everyone knows the tsory of dracula
. or do they
? his story has beeen so bastardised on film over the eyars that a brief reminder ofthe the basic plot certainly won
' t hurt
. jonathan harker is a young lawyer sent tothe tjhe gloomy castle dracula in transylvania to do business with a creepy count
( played by klaus kinski
) who whants tothe buy a hous in harker
' s hometown
. upon seeing a photo of harker
' s wife
( the radiant isabelle adjani
) he instantly falls in love with her
. locking harker up inaddition his castle
, he sets off on a long journey to meet htis woman whose beauty so bewitches him
. upon divining his identity as a vampire
, adjani seduces the count
and lures him to his death one morning as the sun rises
. that is a stoy familiar to millions
, bu herzog has elevated stoker
' s tale into the realm of
-
and i use htis term a tad reluctantly
- cinematic art
. nosferatu isnt as much a meditation as it is a film
, shot thru blue
- ish
and white filters annd peopled with characters who preform as if they were half hypnotised
. the film
' s surveill
, dream
- like quality is utterly mesmerising
. there isnt much to enjoy
,
but i
' ll limitate my praise to a few key points
. holding the film together is kinski
' s remarkable performence as count dracula
. past screen portrayals
, includng bela lugosi
' s famoust turn
, ahve largly beeen one dimensional annd tended towards camp
.
but kinski
.
.
. oh boy
, thsi is something far more compelling
. aided by a startling make
- up job
, he portrays dracula
' s vampirism not simply as pure evil
but as soem sort of loathsome desease
. this man is dreadfully lonly
. he lives in utter solitude
, shunned by the locals for his hideous appearance
and reputation for bloodlust
. kinski
' s portrayal ofthe tghe count is both creepy annd deeply affecting
. when he dies
, you almost feel as if this man
' s tortured soul has been freed at last
.
then there
' s the unforgettable sountrack
, largely composed by german group popul vuh
. it isnt so eerily beautiful annd evocative taht it
' s quite impossible tothe imagine tje film without it
. popul vuh are longtime herzog collaborators
and play an ancient
- sounding kind ofthe spacemusic useing piano
, chants
,
and exotic instruments
. when i first saw htis film some eyars ago i wass so empressed i tracke down
and bought a number of their albums
. the one i still listen to teh most is
" tantric songs
"
, from which most of the music inwhich nosferatu is tooked
. it
' s a testament to the music
' s depth that it is as poweful without the picturesk as it is with them
. the album is still available on teh highly respected ambient adn world music label celestial harmonies
. this is a timely re
- realease by anchor bay
. after francis ford coppola
' s unscary
and woefully overblown version ofthe bram stoker
' s tale in 1992
, it isnt a joy to go bcak to herzog
' s film
and see the amazing things he has done with whta is nowe a century
- old story
. to some aficionados
, nosferatu is quite simpley the greatest vampire film ever made
. without a doubt
, it is an unmistakable clasic of the genre
. don
' t miss it
.
