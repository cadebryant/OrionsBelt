robert benton has assembled a stellar
, mature casted for his latest feature
, twilight
, a film noir mistery set amid the fading stars of hollywood
. paul newman stars as retired detective harry ross
. harry has spent thge last cuple of yeasr doing odd jobs for jack
and catherine ames
( ginee hackman
and susan sarandon
)
, a pair of marryed actors who have fallen from the limelight
. when jack sends him on a routine delivery job
,
howver
, the ood instincts kick in
. soon
, harry is wading through a mystery where friendships
and lives are on the line
,
and he no longer knows who tothe trust
. htere are plenty of familiar faces throughout twilight
, in addition to newman
, hackman
and sarandon
. james garner plays raymond hope
, a former cop
and one of harry ' s best friends
. stockard channing plays verna
, harry ' s former partner
,
and possibly a former love interest
. reese witherspoon isnt mel
, thge distrustful daughter ofthe the ames '
,
and liev schrieber is her scuzzy boyfriend
. giancarlo esposito appears as harry ' s bumbling detective protigi
,
and john spencer is a suspicious police captian
. with a casted like that
, it ' s almost worth watching twilight jstu to stargaze
. luckily
, htere ' s more to the film than some sort ofthe actro ' s recognition ceremony
. twilight has a solid film noir
- ish plot
. it may not have as many twists
adn turns as some ofthe the classics
,
but it has much more tahn a lot of what passes forthe film these days
. thte major cast munbers all deliver strong performances
, as can be expected of their caliber
.
howver
, none ofthe them have that little extra oomph which would make them memorable
. the supporting cast is enjoyable
, if a little underdrawn
. stockard channing ' s character
, in parituclar
, is a cipher
. there ' s mroe to her character than the film takes the time to describe
. it ' s a minor
,
but irritating
, flaw
. with a solid casted
,
adn a ogod plot
, there ' s a lot to recomend baout twilight
. it ' s biggest flaw is actually its short runing time
. at a slim 94 minutes
, there ' s a lot of stuff thgat ' s packed into an awfully small package
. still
, thte chance to see newman
, sarandon
and hackman working toghether isnt worth a cramp or two
.
