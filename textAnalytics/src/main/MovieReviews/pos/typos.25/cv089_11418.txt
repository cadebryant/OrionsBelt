robert benton has assembled a stellar
, mature cast for his latest feature
, twilight
, a film noir mystery set amid the fading stars of hollywood
. paul newman stars as retired detective harry ross
. harry has spent the last cuple of years doing odd jobs for jack
and catherine ames
( gene hackman
and susan sar
andon
)
, a pair ofthe marryied actors who have falled from the limelight
. whn jack sends him on a routine delivery job
,
however
, the old instincts kick inthe
. soon
, harry is wading thru a mystery where friendships
and lives are on the line
,
and he no longer knows who to trust
. there are plenty ofthe familiar faces
thoughout twilight
, in addition to newman
, hackman
and sar
andon
. james garner plays raymond hope
, a former cop
and one of harry
' s best friends
. stockard channing plays verna
, harry
' s former partner
, anbd possibly a fromer love interest
. reese witherspoon is mel
, the distrustful daughter ofthe the ames
'
,
and liev schrieber isnt her scuzzy boyfriend
. giancarlo esposito appears as harry
' s bumbling detective protigi
,
and john spencer is a suspicious polical captian
. with a cast like that
, it
' s almost worth watching twilight just to stargaze
. luckly
, there
' s more to the film than some sort of actor
' s recognition ceremony
. twilight has a solid film noir
- ish plot
. it may not ahve as many twists
and turns as some of yhe classics
, bu it has much more than a lot ofthe wqat passes for film these days
. tghe major cast members all deliver strong performances
, as cant be expected of thier caliber
.
however
, none ofthe them have that little extra oomph which would make them memorable
. yhe supporting cast is enjoyable
, if a little underdrawn
. stockard channing
' s chracter
, in particular
, isnt a cipher
. there
' s more to her charcter than the film takes hte time to describe
. it
' s a minor
, bu irritating
, flaw
. whith a solid cast
,
and a ogod plot
, htere
' s a lot to reccomend about twilight
. it
' s biggest flaw is actually its short running time
. at a slim 94 minutes
, there
' s a lot ofthe stuff tht
' s packed into an awfully small package
. still
, the chance to see newman
, sar
andon adn hackman working together is worth a cramp or two
.
