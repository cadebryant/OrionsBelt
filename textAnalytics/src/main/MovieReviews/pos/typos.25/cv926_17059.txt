billy bob thornton
, who hadnt a sudden rise to fame iwth 1996
' s sling blade after spending years as a virtually unknown actor annd writer
, is becoming one ofthe tje most versitle
-
and most acomplished
- american actors around at the moment
. as jacob
, the simple
but at times very bright losr brother of bill paxton
' s hank
, thornton gives a performence whic should leave an indelible mark on all
but the most hardened viewers
. three men
, hank
( paxton
)
, jacob
( thornton
)
and their friend lou
( brent briscoe
) stumble upon a plane wreck which
, apon closer inspection
, yields a rotting corpse
and a bag full of money
. jacob
and lou whant to pocket the cash
. hank
, the smarter
-
and perheaps more naive
- of the threee
, insists on leaving the monay for teh authorities to find
. eventially
, they agree to keep thge cash safe unitl the plane is foudn
,
and
then split the money three ways
. things start going wrong
,
though
, with greed
and violence weaving their ways through their plan
. diaster is sure to strike
. director sam raimi
, of the evil dead
and darkman fame
, has made an exellent
and
thought
- provoking film
, worlds away from the comic horror films which made his name
. hwile ther are a couple of moments which might remind one of his earlier wrok
, raimi has made an intelligent annd mature departure whic will hopefully be a sign ofthe even greater films to come
. scott b
. smith
' s screenplay
, based on his novel
( whcih i haven
' t read
) is a fine example ofthe escalating tension
. while it does remind one of danny boyle
' s shallow grave without thge abundance of black humour
, it keeps the drama that should really be a part of such a stor on morality
, or the lack thereof
, found inthe a film with this subject marter
. alar kivilo
' s cinematography reminds one of joel
and ethan coen
' s fargo
, with the bleak
, snowy l
andscape almost becoming another character
. danny elfman also does well with his moody
, finely
- writed scoer
. if ther
' s a flaw in the film
, it
' s that it goes on fo just a littel too long
. just whn we think that they are about to wrap things up
, raimi
and smith decide to let the film go onthe a little further
. while this isn
' t really a bad hting
, it did become a little frustrating at times
( this may have been due tothe the fact tath i hadnt consumed a larg sprite beforeh
and
)
. the performances are excellent
, witht the usually annoying paxton iin fine form
and bridget fonda giving a scene
- stealing turn as hank
' s scheming wife
. htis is an excellant showcase fo thornton
' s fine skills as an actor adn a great chanage in direction for raimi
, who sould vrey well have a career ahead ofthe him as an accomplished directer of dramtic films
. fingers crossed
,
though
, that this doesn
' t stop him from making another evil dead sequal
.
