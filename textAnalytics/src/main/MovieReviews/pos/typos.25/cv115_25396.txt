i know thgat
" funnest
" isn
' t a word
.
" fun
" isnt a noun
,
and therefore cannot be conjugated liuke an adjective
.
but thgat
' s the word that came to me right after viewing
" chicken run
.
" no wonder
: this is the kind of movie tath reduces you to childish expressions
, liek
" thta ws thte funnest movie i
' ve ever seen
!
" so tothe hell with webster

-
" chicken run
" isnt one of the funnest movies i
' ve seen in a while
. i can
' t remember the last time i
' ve seen anytying funner
. the chickens at tweedy
' s farm are up to something
. living in a concentration camp
- like atmosphere
, they are led by one plucky hen called ginger
( voice of julia sawalha
) who continually comes uv with plans for escape
-
-
and alwasy gets caught
, subsequently spending day after day in the coal box
. one night
, a brash american rooster flies in over the fence
, calling himselv rocky
( mel gibson
)
, famous flying rooster annd carcus performer
. rocky promises tothe teach thte chickens how to fly
,
and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs
. tweedy
( mir
anda richardson
) decides to ab
andon tje farm
' s egg
- selling plan for a pie
- selling plan
. she orders a huge pie
- mkaing machine
, cackling
,
" chickens go inaddition
; pies come out
.
" what sort of pies
? chicken pies
, of course
. co
- directer nick park
and his studio
, aardman animation
, produced threee oscar
- winning short films
:
" creature comforts
,
"
" the wrong trousers
,
"
and
" a close shave
.
" tyhe latter two were the second
and third installments ofthe a triology starring the delightful team wallace
& gromit
, a man anbd his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures
. part of what made teh
" wallace
" films brilliantly entertaining was park
' s uncanny ability to make an old story seem new
.
" teh wrong trousers
,
" for exemple
, pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks
,
and
" a close shave
" owed a great deal of inspiration tothe classic detective stories
.
but in the h
ands of park
and his team
, the stories felt fresh
and inspired
,
and not the least bit contrived
. now teaming with co
- director peter lord
, park has created a similar creature inwhich
" chicken run
.
" the plot is largely lifted ffrom
" tghe great escape
"
( watch for a quick reference to the ball
- bouncing scene
)
, with some spielberg
- inspired action sequences providing the excitement
. thing isnt
, the film doesn
' t feel like it
' s been lifted from somwhere else
;
" chicken run
" fiels fresh
, alive
, like nothing else ever done
. part ofthe it is the orignal idea
: who in the world came up witht the idea to make a prisoners
- ofthe
- war movie starring chickens
? park anbd lord milk teh incongruity forthe all it
' s worth
: the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious
,
and to them
, it is
.
but tehy
' re
* chickens
*
, so it
' s funny to us
. anyother thnig that helps
" chicken run
"
(
and most of park
' s films
) succeed isnt the animators
' subtle way ofthe giving nods to teh very films they
' re cribbing
. there are refrences to
" thge great excape
,
" obviously
,
and
" stalag 17
.
" the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both
" raiders of the lost ark
"
and
" indiana jones
and tjhe temple of doom
.
" htere
' s even a nod tothe
" the blues brothers
,
" if yuo cin believe it
,
and the filmmakers even get inspite a little light
- hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actro
, taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson
' s nationality
and film history
. the
" braveheart
" reference is a hoot if you catch it
. when you consider just how fine a line resides bewteen a funny parody
and a redundant oney
,
" chicken run
" is downright brilliant in its excecution
. consider tihs
: since july of lastr year
, i
' ve seen dozens upon dozens of
" blair witch project
" parodies
, onthe television
, on the rdio
, adn online
. out ofthe all those
, mabey one or twpo were amusing
, the rest tiresome
. why
? because once you got past the
thought that
" they
' re parodying thgat
&
# 8216
; blair witch
' movei
,
" most of tje parodies had nothing tothe offer
-
- noone insight
, noone original idea
, no greater purpose
. they were onyl funny if you hadnt seen the movei
; otherwise
, ytou got nothing
. conversly
,
" chicken run
" doesn
' t lean on its parodies
-
- the film references are never the sole focuse ofthe any scene
. if you
' ve never seen
" indiana jones
,
" the chase sequence is still fun
. even if you have no idea who mel gibson is
, rocky remeniss an interesting character
. park
, lord
,
and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize tath an audience does not ened a parody shoved in their faces before it
' s understood
,
and as a result
,
" chicken run
" isnt filled with visual
and verbal jabs that are never too obvious
,
but not quite vague either
. enjoyment of this movei doesn
' t require knowledge of film histoy
,
but if you
' ve got it
,
" chicken run
" is thyat much richer
. the voice cast turns inaddition uniformly lively performances
, annd the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it
' s hard not to fall infront love with eveyr one of them
. ginger is perfect
, spunky
and opinionated
,
but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind
,
and julia sawalha
( known as the cute mousy girl onthe
" absolutely fabulous
"
) nails it
. she has warm
, human chemestry with gibson
, whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung
- ho veneer
. the characters
' inevitable romance doesn
' t feel contrived
,
but sweet
. poor mr
. tweedy
( tony haygarth
) suspects the chickens are organizing in smoe way
,
but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring thnigs outloud
, adn his overbearing wife certainly isn
' t any help
. jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs
( a hen that runs awya with most of the best noe
- liners
, all while perpetually crocheting a sweater
)
, adn twpo supply
- trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during tghe lively central swing
- dancing sequence
. htey even cmo up wtih an inpsired riff on something that
' s baffled scholars
and theologians alike fo decades
: the chicken vs
. egg delimma
. one might have expected this inevatible joke to come off as wearisome
,
but as with most of
" chicken run
,
" it comes as a delightful surprise
. the film manages to cross all barriers
; it should be accessible to both children
and adults
, brits
and yanks
, rats
and chickens
. the animation is first
- rate
. remember that this was all done the old
- fashioned way
, with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bited by painstaking bit
, adn you see just how truely remarkable
" chicken run
" relaly is
. htis movie possesses that smae qualty that makes pixar studios
' animation great
: precise
and unwavering attention to detail
. as in such top
- notch family fare as
" a bug
' s life
" or
" toy story 2
,
"
" chicken run
" has something to offer in nearly every frame
. certainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward stroy iwth a worthwhile moral
and some surprisingly touching scenes
, bu a active
, attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they
' ll catch all the details
. anyway
, tjhe movei
' s just a boatload ofthe fun
. funnest damn movei i
' ve seen all year
.
