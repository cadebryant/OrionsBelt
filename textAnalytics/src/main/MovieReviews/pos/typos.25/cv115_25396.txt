i know that
" funnest
" isn ' t a word
.
" fun
" is a noun
,
and therefore cannnot be conjugated like an adjective
.
bu that ' s the word thgat came to me right after viewing
" chicken run
.
" no wonder
: thsi is the kind of movei that reduces you to childish expressions
, liek
" that ws the funnest movie i ' ve ever seen
!
" so to hell witht webster ' s
-
-
" chicken run
" is one of yhe funnest movies i ' ve seen in a while
. i can ' t remember the last tiome i ' ve seen anything funner
. the chickens at tweedy ' s farm are up to something
. living iin a concentration camp
- like atmosphere
, tehy are led by one plucky hen called ginger
( voice of julia sawalha
) who continually comes up withthe plans for excape
-
-
and always gets caught
, subsequently spending day affter day in the coal box
. one night
, a brash american rooster flies in over the fence
, calling himself rocky
( mel gibson
)
, famous flying rooster
anbd circus performer
. rocky promises tothe teach tje chickens how to fly
,
and hte situation grows more esperate as the nefarious mrs
. tweedy
( miranda richardson
) decides to abandon yhe farm ' s egg
- selling plan forthe a pie
- selling plan
. she orders a huge pie
- mkaing machine
, cackling
,
" chickens go in
; pies come outloud
.
" waht sort of pies
? chicken pies
, ofthe course
. co
- director nick park
and his studio
, aardman animation
, produced three oscar
- winning short films
:
" creature comforts
,
"
" the wrong trousers
,
"
and
" a close shave
.
" the latter twpo were the second
and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace
& gromit
, a man
annd his dog famous fo getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures
. part of what made hte
" wallace
" films brilliantly entertaining wass park ' s uncanny ability to make an ood story seem newyorker
.
" the wrong trousers
,
" for example
, pulled out a lot ofthe old hitchcockian suspense tricks
,
and
" a close shave
" owed a great dael ofthe inspiration to clasic detective stories
.
but inwhich the hands of park
and his team
, the stories feeled fresh
anbd inspired
,
and nto the least bit contrived
. now teaming with co
- director peter lord
, park has creaeted a similar creature infront
" chicken run
.
" the plot isnt largely lifted ffrom
" the great escape
"
( watch fo a quick reference to the ball
- bouncing scene
)
, with some spielberg
- inspired action sequences providing the excitement
. thing isnt
, the film doesn ' t efel like it ' s beeen lefted from somewhere else
;
" chicken run
" feels fresh
, alive
, like nothing eles ever done
. part of it is teh original idea
: who iin the world came up wiht the idea to make a prisoners
- ofthe
- war movei starring chickens
? park
and lord milk the incongruity for all it ' s worth
: the charactors treat their situation as if it were dead sereous
,
and to them
, it is
.
but they ' re
* chickens
*
, so it ' s funny to us
. another thing that helps
" chicken run
"
(
and most ofthe park ' s films
) suceed is the animators ' subtle way of giving nods tothe the very films they ' re cribbing
. there are references to
" tje great excape
,
" obviously
,
and
" stalag 17
.
" the chase sequence inside thte chicken grinder parodies both
" raiders of the lost ark
"
and
" indiana jones
anbd the temple of doom
.
" ther ' s even a nod to
" the blues brothers
,
" if you can beieve it
,
and yhe filmmakers even git inthe a little light
- hearted ribbing at the expence of their star voice actor
, taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson ' s nationality
anbd film history
. the
" braveheart
" reference is a hoot if you catch it
. when yuo consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody
annd a redundant noe
,
" chicken run
" is downright brilliant inwhich its execution
. consider this
: sicne july ofthe last year
, i ' ve seen dozens upon dozens ofthe
" blair witch project
" parodies
, on television
, on the radio
,
annd online
. out of all those
, maybe one or two were amusing
, teh rest tiresome
. why
? beccause once ytou got past the thought that
" they ' re parodying that
&
# 8216
; blair witch ' movie
,
" most of the parodies hadnt nothing to offer
-
- no insight
, no original diea
, noone greater purpose
. tehy were only funny if you had seen the movie
; otherwise
, you got nothing
. conversly
,
" chicken run
" doesn ' t lean on its parodies
-
- the film references are never thge sole focus of any scene
. if you ' ve never seen
" indiana jones
,
" the chase sequence isnt still fun
. even if you have no idea who mel gibson is
, rocky remains an intresting chracter
. park
, lord
,
and screenwrighter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audiance does not need a parody shoved in their faces befoer it ' s understood
,
and as a result
,
" chicken run
" is filled witht visual
and verbal jabs that are never too obvious
,
but not quite vague either
. enjoyment of this movie doesn ' t recquire knowlege of film history
,
but if you ' ve got it
,
" chicken run
" is that much richer
. the voice cast turns in uniformly livley performances
,
and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances thyat it ' s hard not tothe fall in love with every one ofthe them
. ginger is perfect
, spunky
and opinionated
,
bu with a soft heart that forbids her tothe leave her companions behind
,
and julia sawalha
( known as the cute mousy girl on
" absolutly fabulous
"
) nails it
. she has warm
, human chemistry with gibson
, whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung
- ho veneer
. tjhe characters ' inevatible romance doesn ' t fiel contrived
,
but sweet
. poor mr
. tweedy
( tony haygarth
) suspects the chickens are organizing infact some way
,
but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out
,
and his overbearing wife certainly isn ' t any help
. jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs
( a hen taht runs away with most of the best oen
- liners
, all while perpetually crocheting a sweater
)
,
and twpo supply
- trading rats that seem tothe have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show druing the lively central swing
- dancing sequence
. tehy even come up wiht an inpsired riff on something that ' s baffled scholars
and theologians alike forthe decades
: the chicken vs
. egg dilemma
. one might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome
,
but as with most ofthe
" chicken run
,
" it comes as a delightful surprise
. the film manages to cross all barriers
; it should be accessible to both children
and adults
, brits
and yanks
, rats
and chickens
. thte animation is first
- rate
. remeber that this was all done tghe old
- fashioned way
, with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny setted bit by painstaking bit
,
and you see jstu how truly remarkable
" chicken run
" really is
. this movie possessess that smae quality thyat makes pixar studios ' animation great
: precise
and unwavering attention to detail
. as inwhich such top
- notch family fare as
" a bug ' s life
" or
" toy story 2
,
"
" chicken run
" has something to offer inspite nearly every frome
. certainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral
anbd some surprisingly touching scenes
,
but a active
, attentive viewers will enjoy it even mroe baceause tehy ' ll catch all the details
. anyway
, the movie ' s just a boatload of funn
. funnest damn movie i ' ve seen all year
.
