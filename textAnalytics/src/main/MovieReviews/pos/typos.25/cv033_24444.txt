inaddition wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer
\ professor with such lived
- in naturalism thyat i beileve it may be his best peformance
. ever usance wall strent
, douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations onthe tyhe shark in a suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid
- 80
' s
. in those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence ofthe cutthroat businessmen
, wih much frothing at tje mouth while projecting all his bad intentions to the world
. yuo
' d think such a man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath a good
- natured veneer
,
but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton
, douglas palyed tyhe role straight
and out in the open
. in wonder boys his performence isn
' t showy or a tour de force
, it
' s simple
yet truthful
. he embodies grady
, a craggy old writter with a predilection for pot
and pink bathrobes
. grady instructs a writers workshop while working tirelessly onthe a follow up tothe the novel that put him onthe the map
. when we first encounter this curmudgeon in hte midst of his workshop
, we hear his sardonic narration on hte sountrack as students bombard one of their own wih unfair criticisms
. grady points out
, in his narration
, that they only dont so out of jealousy
. thier target is tje very writerly named james leer
( played by the always understated tobey maguire
)
, a student full of potential
and noe whom grady develops a mild affection for
. leer is tjhe kind of youth who seems tothe mechanically block out emotions
. he speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just a hint of dry wit around the edges
. he
' s portentous
and gloomy
, as if modeling himself after the great depressed writers
,
though his ect is a little too calculated
. he reminds me of the self
- imposed outcast film director
, jim jarmusch
( dead man
, ghost dog
)
. whenever i happen to catch jarmusch inaddition an interview i see the man speaking inaddition a toneless manner
( the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer
)
, exculsivly dressed in black
, annd with his spiked hair dyed snow white
. leer is similar
, a guy who equates quirks with depth
. tobey maguire fits well in the role
. with his round
, sweet
- eerie face he resembles bud cort from harold
and maude
.
but unlike cort
, maguire is easier to warm up to
; he
' s a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility
. katie holmes plays hannah
, a beautiful
, talented writing student jstu itching to get in grady
' s pants
. this is a plot line i had trouble with
. douglas
, infront his ood age
, is beginning to resemble jerry springer
, a man who has actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasions
. at first i found it extrememly difficult to believe that someone as beatiful as hannah woudl desire grady
( maybe it
' s because i
' m jealous
,
and wish holmes was throwing herself at me
, after all i may jstu be a lowly internet critic
but at least i still hvae all my teeth
)
,
then i htink of douglas
' s rela life companion
, the breathtaking catherine zeta jones
. seeing those two together looks a lot like a kidnapping
. suddenly my mind has shifted from the task at h
and
( that being reviewing this completely wonderful movie
)
and i
' m pontificating onthe why yhe hell jones would desire douglas
. there is a movie in there somewhere
. grady
, rether chivalrously if you ask me
, resists the charms of hannah for sara gaskell
( a droll frances mcdorm
and
)
, who is his age
,
but also married tothe another proffesor
. okay
, maybe not so chivalrous
. there is a great line infact the film spoken by douglas baout sara where he sasy
,
" she ws a junkie for the printed word
. lucky for me i manufactured her drug ofthe choice
"
. robert downy j
. r plays a bisexual editor who makes his entrance with a towering transvestite on his arm
. downy hasnt mastered the gleefully dry hyper articulate wit of many a hipster intelectual
. he
' s arrogant
but completely likeable inaddition his utter arrogance
. the actor is perfectly casted here
,
and remains a joyous movei presence somewhere between a typical tom hanksian comic leading man adn edgy character actor
. i wish wonder boys hadnt more of him
. searching forthe a plot among the elements of wonder boys would be pointless
, fo it me
anders thru its running tyme
, bu tyhat
' s part of its charm
. anbd maybe i
' m a bit biased towards the film because it takes place inaddition a haven of literary academia
, a place i
' m greatly fond of
,
and a palce rarley explored iin american cinema
. everyone has a sub
- genre
( be it war films
, westerns
, dance movies
) thgat they happen to be privy to
. i
' m privy to films baout literary types i
. e
. those individuals enthralled by the written owrd
, anbd if you are nto so inclined it may be wise to knock my above grade down baout half a notch
. thte direction by curtis hanson is more akin to a european film with its leisurely pace anbd situations that grwo from the characters
, rether than generic mapped out story points
. sometimes the dialogue is too clever
,
but thta
' s a problem i wish i foudn with films more often
. another minor quibble is that early on tjhe film seems a bit too introverted
, like its characters
,
but as the story progresses it begins to open up
. for me wonder boys works as subtle drama because of its insight into artistic types
,
and as a low
- key comedy for its chuckle
- worthy throwaway gags
. teh gags are like thsoe in the great robert altman
( m
* a
* s
* h
, the long goodbye
) movies
, where jokes exist as asides on the fringes
, liuke jokes in life often do
. the broader comedy such as the killing of a blind dog
,
and incessant smoking of marijuana isn
' t ineffective
but not nearly as memorable as tje little thnigs
. curtis hanson
, who before his lastest film
, la confidential
, toiled about with explotation fare like losin
' it
( an early tom cruise sex comedy
)
and the h
and the rocks hte cradle
, has graduated to more meaningful films
. he directs wonder boys in an appropriately dour style
, the comedy coming ffrom tyhe false gloom his characters put up
. the morose crooning ofthe leonard cohen would seem an odd song for tje background of any party
, bu in a wonder boys party
, it fits
. the film is like a peice of literature put up on the big screen
. it
' s the cinematic equivalent to a ogod read
, novelistic in its aproach with themes rarely found in american movies
. many will fidn it slight
,
but i foudn much to savor among its subtleties
.
