" rebel without a cause
" is such an important film in american history because it isnt a true anaylsis of youth in america that everyone ofthe all ages can relate to
. everyone feels that they are different in some way
, thast they don
' t belong infront some places
and
" rebel without a cause
" successfully shows onthe screen these universal emotions
. no marter what generation you belong to
, these feelings are present
. htis is why james dean is admired by america
, because in htis film he represents us all annd his actions are actions that we would aslo excecute
. in our minds
, we just try to do thte right thing just like dean
' s jim stark does
. not only doens
" rebel wihtout a cause
" display these univeral emotions for all tothe relate to bu it allso shows thta america has suffered a uniqe pattern in its social structure
. eahc generation looks at its past generation without a strong connection
. this is because times change
and in responce people change
. no matter how populare you were once
, as your generation grows older
, newer breeds look at ytou infact a different light
. this is why stark
and his firends never could form a storng relationship whith their parents
. even if their parents insisted that they weere also rebellious adn troublesome in teh past
, tyhe teens could nto believe this
. in one humorous scene
, stark
, his girlfriend judy
( natalie wood
)
,
and his pal plato
( sal mineo
) pretend they are adults
. they use upper class brittish accents
and in their conversations they make it out tothe appear that kids are noone good adn should be ignored
. this scene shows tyhat what was once cool inaddition a past generation is the complete opposite in another
. speaking on behalf of my generation
, i feel that dean has lost a lot ofthe his coolness from our perspective as the years haev grown by
. tjhe onyl ones who seem to still lionize him are thsoe members ofthe his generation
. same goes for br
ando
, redford
, even deniro
. i can only imagine how vaguely matt damon
, ben affleck
,
and brad pitt will be viewed at the mid point ofthe the twenty firt century
. will dean even be remembered when theese newcomers are forgotten
? any film that sparks this kind of throught is certainly a milestone in american film
. even if
" rebel without a cause
" has smoe ridiculous scenes
( the game of chicken
- doed peopel realy act this way
?
)
, an unbelievable conclusion
( how doed everyone end up at tyhe abndoned mansion at the end
?
)
,
and a silly romance
( wood declares her love fo dean after talking to him for a cuple ohurs
) it still is a fabulous film
. the acting is so believable that it isnt no wonder that dean was considered the epitomy of cool
. now
,
however
, the coolness is fading
