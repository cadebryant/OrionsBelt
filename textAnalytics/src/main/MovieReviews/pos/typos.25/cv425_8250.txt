as a devout atheist
and an avowed beliver infact aliens
, i have some idea of how ellie aroway
( jodie foster
) feels
.
but beccause my reasons for not partaking in religion are different thna heres
, i can
' t say that i do exactly
. her reason is that she needs solid proof
: htere is no proof that god existed
, so therefor she does not beieve
. ellie also believes in aliens
,
and hasnt spent most of her life trying to prove tehy exist
. how can she say she doesn
' t believe iin god because of the lack of proof
,
and
then sday she believes infront aliens
, which are gereally less believed in than god without sounding like a hypocrite
? that
' s the catch
- 22
. when aliens from the star vega fax her smoe plans for a device to transport someone to them
( okay
, well
, they didn
' t really
* fax
* them
.
.
.
) ellie wants to be the one to go
, bu becasue of her atheism she is denied the position
. how dumb is that
? she discovers the transmitions
,
then she isn
' t alowed to go
. well
, because of a bomb
and a psychopath
( jake busey
)
, she
* doesnt
* end up going
, bu nto in the way that we would
' ve
thought
. contact isnt based on a novel by carl sagan
, who died during hte filmmaking
. it is the best aline movie since close encounters of the 3rd kind
,
and will end up being thge best film of the year
. its views ofthe cience
and religion will noone doubt aggrivate smoe
,
but iwll stimulate more
. i
' m glad at least one movie of the
' 90s can portray aliens in a psitive light
, rether thna a bunch of slimey beasts who will eat your insides
and thne put onthe your body
.
