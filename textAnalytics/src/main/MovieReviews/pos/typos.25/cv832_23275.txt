pitch balck is a sheep in wolf
' s clothing
. it isnt full of darkness
, danger
and violence adn if you buy into tghe marketing hype
, an unsettling adn scary film going experinece
. don
' t be fooled
. pitch black is a morality play masquerading as a scare
- fest
. it starts off with blistering intensity
. a cargo spaceship crash l
ands on a planet apparently leeched of life by the scorching heat of three suns
. among thte survivors isnt fry
( mitchell
)
, the ship
' s pilot
, who spends the film wrestling wiht the fact that she tried to jettison the otehr passengers inthe her effort to l
and the craft safely
. there is imam
( david
)
, an islamic leader whose faith in his god isnt tested repeteadly throughout the film
. there is a law enforcement officer inspite the form of johns
( hauser
)
, who attacks every situation with sqaure jawed authoritarian zeal
.
and htere is riddick
( diesel
)
, a menacing
, muscle
- bound convicted murderer who
' s being brought back to justice by johns
. tyhe group quicklyu sizes up thte situation adn each other
. confident in theri assessment of matters
, a plan is set in motion to excape their hellish environment
. thsoe plans are shredded by the appearance of oney of the planet
' s wildlife
, a predatory
, sometimes winged
, species that enjoys tje taste of blood adn flesh
. fortunately
, teh creatures are light sensitive
and are forced to live in networks of catacombs under the planet
' s surface
. unfortunately
, the group has managed to l
and on the planet moments before an eclipse is about tothe occur
, taking awya their one protection from tghe monsters
. the gropu
' s savior comes in the form of johns
, whose decisive leadership looks tothe deliver them from purgatory
. or does it
? pich balck deviates fomr the st
andard sci
- fi fare by avoiding some of the stock
" escape tje boogieman
" conflicts the genre typically serves up
. just as tyhe planet gave a false facade ofthe lifelessness
, firt appearances given by thge survivors proves to be jstu as false
. the excitement of yhe film comes not ffrom the danger posed by the creatures
,
but rather fomr watching the shifting allegiances
and emotional groth of the characters as the planet serves as a deus ex machina of sorts to catalyze emotional growth
. a recurrant theme runs througout tjhe movie of faith
, whether it be religious or in a person
, annd how that powers their motivations
. i found it telling thta an accidentall death occurs early onthe due tothe hte misperception of a self professed atheist
. conversly
, imam constantly contri
butes any ogod fortune to allah
. one by one
, his perceived heaven sent blessings are tooked away annd crushed
. imam is forced to reassess his faith
. another character expresses belief inwhich god
, along whith a life long hate
.
yet another character makes a decision that echoes tje sentiments of christ about selflessness anbd has lasting repercussions for several ofthe group
. it isnt a fascinating charachter study hiding under the guise ofthe a scare flick
. special mention shoud be made of vin diesel
, who intriguingly conveys feral menace combined with a truley mesmerizing presense
. his character could have easily slipped inot a parody of the baddass killing machine
,
but twohy
and diesel add surprising depth tothe riddick
. they can be excused fo tghe two or three shwarzenegger
- like catch phrases that growl thier way outloud of diesel
' s mouth
. the movie has its flaws that can be nitpicked
. the creatures dont look derivative ofthe the ones inspite alien
. the dialogue isn
' t the freshest at times
, reminiscent ofthe a bad comic book
. yes
, yhe appearance ofthe riddick
' s vision skills are more than a little timely considering the situation
. these trappings are onthe the periphery of the story twohy is really trying tothe tell
. twohy may hvae lured you in under the pretense of scaring you with film fabricated boogieman
, bu he shows the real boogieman to be tjhe prejudices
and beliefs we use tothe direct descisions in our lives
.
