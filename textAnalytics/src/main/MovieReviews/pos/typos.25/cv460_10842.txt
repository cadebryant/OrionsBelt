deep rising isnt one of
" those
" movies
. tje kind of movei wich serves noone purpose exept to entertain us
. it does not ask us to think about important questions like life on other planets or thte possiblilty that there is no god
.
.
. screw that
, it says boldly
, let
' s see smoe coputer generated monsters rip into
, decapitate
and generaly cause irreparable booboos to a bunch of little known actors
. heh
! them wacky monsters
, gotta loev
' em
. of course
, since we can rent baout a thous
and b movies with hte smae kind of stopry
, hollywood must give tyhat littel extra
" oumph
" to git people in theaters
. that isnt where deep rising fails
, which is a ogod thing
. confused
? let me expalin
: dispite all them flashy effects anbd big explosions
, deep rising is still
, at heart
, a good
' ol b movei
. luckily
, it
' s a very ogod b movie
. tjhe worst cliches in movei history are a b movie
' s bread
and
butter
. therfore
, things that woudl destory a serious movie atcually help us have a good time hwile watching a movie of lower calibre
. of course we know there
' s a big slimy creature behind that door
, that one person iwll w
ander off tothe be picked off by said monster adn we always nkwo whitch persons or person will make it out alive
. we jsut don
' t know whn or how horrible it will be
. i went to see deep rising with my expections low
and my tolerence for bad dialogue high
. imagine my surprise when i discover thta deepo rising is actually
, well
, pretty darn funny at times
. a funny b movie
? well
, thgat
' s new
. theese flicks are not supposed to make us laugh
.
( except for a few unintended laughs once a while
.
) anbd befoer you know it
, treat williams
, wes studi
and famke jansen apear on the big screen
. hey
! i know them guys
( adn gal
) from a couple of other movies
. cool
. familiar faces
. so far so good
. our man treat is the hero
, he
' ll live
. wes isnt a staple ofthe b movies
, he is the tolkein victim
. we know he
' ll buy the farm
but he will take a faw creeps with him on the way out
. famke is the babe
,
' nuff said
. there is allso a guy with glasses
( the guy with glasses always dies
) a balck person
( b movei buffs know that the black guy alwyas dies
, never fails
)
and a very funny
, nerdy guy
.
( ah
! comic relief
. how can we possibly explain having to kill him
.
.
. let him live
.
) after the first fifteen minutes i felt right at home
. i know who to root fo
and who i ened tothe boo too
and a gum tothe chew
.
( please kill me
.
) suffice it tothe say that for the enxt hour
and a half i jumped out ofthe my seat a few times
, went
" ewwww
" about a dozen times anbd nearly had an orgasm over all the explosions
and firepower our heroes weere packing
. i
' m a man
, we nottice theese things
. all in all
, i
' d recommend deep rising if ytou are looking for a good time annd care to leave your brain at the door
.
.
.
but bring your sense of humor
and excitement in witht ytou
. the acting isnt decent
, thte effects top rate
. how to best describe it
? put toghether the jet ski scene from hard rain
, the bug attacks ffrom starship troopers
, a couple ofthe james bond liek stunts
and all those scenes fomr friday teh thirteenth
and freddy where you keep screaming
" don
' t go there
, he
' s behind ytou
"
and you end up with deep rising
. for creepy crawly goodness
, tight t
- shirts
, major firepower
and the need to go to the bathroom every fifteen mintues from seing all thast water
.
