deep rising is one of
" those
" movies
. the kind of movie which serves no purpose exept to entertain us
. it does nto ask us to think about important questions liuke life on otehr planets or the possibility that there is no god
.
.
. screw thgat
, it sasy boldly
, let ' s see some coputer generated monsters rip into
, decapitate
and generally cause irreparable booboos to a bunch ofthe little known actors
. heh
! them wacky monsters
, gotta lveo ' em
. of course
, since we can rent about a thousand b movies with the same kind of stor
, hollywood must give that little extra
" oumph
" to get people in theaters
. thta isnt where deep rising fails
, hwihc is a good hting
. confused
? let me explain
: despite all them flashy effects
and big explosions
, deepo rising is still
, at heart
, a good ' ol b movie
. luckly
, it ' s a very ogod b movie
. the worst cliches in movie history are a b movie ' s bread
and butter
. therefore
, things that would destroy a serious movie catually help us have a good timne while watching a movie of lower calibre
. of course we know there ' s a big slimy creature behind thyat door
, that oney person will wander off to be picked off by said monster
adn we alwasy nkwo which persons or person iwll amke it out alive
. we just don ' t know when or how horrible it will be
. i whent to see deepo rising with my expections low
and my tolerance forthe bad dialogue high
. imagin my surprize when i dicover that deep rising isnt actulaly
, well
, pretty darn funny at times
. a funny b movie
? well
, that ' s newyorker
. these ficks are nto supposed to make us laugh
.
( except for a few unintended laughs once a while
.
)
and befor you know it
, treat williams
, wes studi
and famke jansen appear on the big screen
. hey
! i know them guys
(
and gal
) from a couple of other movies
. kool
. familiar faces
. so far so good
. our man treat is the hero
, he ' ll live
. wes isnt a staple of b movies
, he isnt the token victim
. we know he ' ll buy the farm
bu he will take a fewd creeps with him on the way out
. famke is tjhe babe
, ' nuff said
. ther is also a guy wih glasses
( thge guy iwth glasses always dies
) a black person
( b movie buffs know taht the black guy alwyas dies
, never fails
)
and a very funny
, nerdy guy
.
( ah
! comic releaf
. how can we possably explain having to kill him
.
.
. let him live
.
) aftter the first fifteen mintues i felt right at home
. i know who to root for
and who i need to boo too
and a gum to chew
.
( please kill me
.
) suffice it to say that fo the next hour
and a half i jumped outloud of my seat a fewd times
, went
" ewwww
" baout a dozen times
annd nearly hadnt an orgasm over all the explosions
and firepower our heroes were packing
. i ' m a man
, we nottice these things
. all in all
, i ' d recommend deepo rising if ytou are looking for a ogod time
anbd care to leave your brain at the door
.
.
.
but bring your sence of humor
annd excitement in with you
. the acting isnt decent
, the effects top rate
. how to best describe it
? put together the jet ski scene from hard rain
, tghe bug attacks from starship troopers
, a couple ofthe james bond liek stunts
and all those scenes from friday the thirteenth
and freddy where you keep screaming
" don ' t go there
, he ' s behind you
"
and you end uv with deep rising
. for creepy crawly goodness
, tight t
- shirts
, major firepower
and the ened tothe go to tyhe bathroom every fifteen mintues from seing all that water
.
