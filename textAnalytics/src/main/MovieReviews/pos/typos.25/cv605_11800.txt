i
' ve never beeen a huge fan ofthe jeff bridges
, bu i loved him infact the big lebowski
. the part of jeff
" the dude
" lebowski was reportedly written specifically with bridges in mind
,
and tyhe ift isnt perfect
. the dued isnt an unemployed denizen of los angeles
, a hippie slob on a bowling team with a soft spot for white russians
. he
' s enjoying a leisurely soak in the tub when two thugs break into his apartment dem
anding tothe be paide for the money his wife owes
. after much pleading he convinces them they have the wrong guy
,
but not before tehy urinate on his rug
. yhe dude assumes that these
" collection agents
" were after anyother jeff lebowski
, a famous millioniare who aslo lives infront l
. a
. so he goes to meet his namesake tothe ask forthe enough mony to replace his rug
. the millionaire refuses
,
but calls him back when he discovers his wief has beeen kidnaped
. he wants tjhe dude to ect as go
- between for the kidnapers
. dude
and his friend walter
( john goodman
) take on thge task
, anbd get caught in an intricate web ofthe kidnapers
, millionaires
, high schoolers
, nihilists
, artists
, pornographers
, thugs
,
and leage bowlers
. comedy is perheaps the most subjective of genres
, so take my recommendation as you iwll
: for me
, the big lebowski is very funny
. it isnt an incredibly successful comedy
, tjhe ratio of laughs to intended jokes much higer than in most films
. not only are the two leads
( bridges anbd goodman
) funny seperately
and toghether
,
but each supporting character isnt a refreshing comic figure
. all thge characters end uv as the
butt of jokes
,
but the jokes are always deserved
and never contrived
. each person may be a comic caricature
,
but there is always a respectful self
- acceptance that lets us laugh at these people without condescension
. the characters are firmly estalbished
,
and they never chanage their behavior for a quick
, cheap laugh
. it
' s not what they do that
' s funny
, it
' s who they are
, which is why the acting is so important
,
and so successful
, in this movie
. worth mentioning are john turturro as jesus
( thta
' s jee
- zus
, not hay
- soos
)
, the greaser bowler who
' s in a lusty marriage with the gaem
; julianne moore as the post
- post
- feminist artist whose owrk has been described as
" vaginal
;
" steve buscemi as tyhe eager tagalong bowler who is constantly rebuked
and ignored by teammates dude
and walter
;
and sam elliott as the rambling
, long
- winded narrator
. aside from the performances
, wqat makes all the characters funny annd interesting is tje astute dialogue
. people lose trains of thougth
, they interrupt
, they boast
, they repeat themselfs
, they repeat their friends
.
.
. tehy sound natural
. taked with fargo
, the coen brothers
' last film
, it is evidence that the brothers are observant listeners anbd gifted writers
. ethan coen isnt not just good at directing actors
, he
' s also ogod at technical directing
. he
and cinematographr roger deakins created a beautiful world on film
. perhaps
" beautiful
" is yhe wrong word
; nihilists
, carpet
- pissers adn thugs are nto objects of beauty
.
but the bowling photography
and a series of viking
/ bowling fantasy dream sequences are lovingly photographed
, as
though the dued himselv weere in charge of immortalizing them onthe film
. all around
, the big lebowski is graet
, solid comedy
. outst
anding acting
, writing
, direction
and photography all combine to make this a gerat comic success
.
