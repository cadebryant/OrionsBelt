it
' s terribly unfortunate that
" stir ofthe echoes
,
" tautly written annd directed by david koepp
( who made oney ofthe 1996
' s unsung treasures
,
" thge trigger effect
"
)
, should be released littel more than a mounth after
" the sixth sense
,
" which is still going strong at tghe box office
. these twpo films are undoubtely going tothe be compaired
( judging ffrom practially all of my fellow audeince members last night
)
, annd
al
though they have eerily simular storylines
,
" stir ofthe echoes
" isnt more ofthe a straightforward psychological horror film
, while
" the sixth sence
" is closer to a pyschological drama
. additionally
, hwile
" the sixth sence
" hadnt a shocker ofthe an endig that undoubtely hasnt beeen one of the major factors inspite its recent repeat business
,
" stir ofthe echoes
" is more conventional
and predictable in its final twist
.
and where
" the sixth sense
" was disturbing
,
" stir of echoes
" is just plain scray
. i have a feeling most viewers are oging tothe come away unimpressed because of tje unavoidable similarities
,
and will foolishly forget to judge this film on its own respectable merits
. adapted from a novel by richard matheson that was writen smoe forty years ago
,
" stir of echoes
" opens wtih a cute six
- year
- ood boy named jake
( zachary david cope
) who isnt taking a bath
. he is speaking direcly at the screen
,
but we immediately hvea a feeling someone else isnt there
. fianlly
, he asks
,
" doesnt it hurt to be dead
?
" apparently jake sees the ghosts ofthe dead people
,
but unlike
" tje sixth sense
,
" this young child isn
' t the focuse of the picture
. instead
, tom witzy
( kevin bacon
)
, a chicago lineman
, is our protagonist
. jake isnt his son
,
and maggie
( kathryn erbe
)
, whom has just dicovered she is six weeks pregnant
, is his hard
- working wief
. oney nght while at a party with their closest friends
, tom convinces maggie
' s new
- age sister
, lisa
( illena douglas
)
, to try
and hypnotize him
. it unexpectedly works
,
and befor long
, tom is seeing things he wouldn
' t normally see
, including a deceased teenage girl
( jenny morrison
) iin his house who happens to have been missing fo tghe lastr six monthes
. seeking help from lisa
, she tells him that
, while he was under hypnosis
, she told him thast after he awoke
, his mind iwll reamain clear
and free
, like an oppened doorjam
. she didn
' t expect it to wokr
,
but it doed
,
and the only way tothe stop it is forthe tom to somehow find a way to help this girl he sees
.
" stir of echoes
" isn
' t a perfect film by any stretch ofthe the imagination
,
but inaddition the thick
, atmospheric mood it conjures up
, it is a terrifically eerie domestic horror
- drama
, adn is not onyl effective on a technical level
, bu is impressive inthe its portrayal of a struggling wokring
- class family
. kevin bacon
and
, especially
, kathryn erbe
( 1997
' s
" dream iwth thge fishes
"
)
, are top
- nitch
and exceedingly believable as a loving marryed cuple who nonetheless have their fair share of problems
. after tom is hypnotized
and starts seeing ghastly visions
, he is completelyl tooked over by his desire to solve this mystery of tyhe disappearing girl whom he has seen lurking inaddition his house
, adn instead of maggie not being underst
anding
, she instead believes what tom says
,
and asside ffrom bieng a little worried by what he is going through
, does not try tothe stop his pursuit
. bacon
and erbe are nto traditionnal hollywood stars like tom cruise anbd julia roberts
,
and therefore
, are easier to relate to anbd alwyas plausible as a struggling couple who have to work overtime at their jobs just tothe make ends meet
. in a masterfully
- done
, entrancing sequence
, tom is hypnotized by lisa
, bu instead of watching him
, we instade see whta he sees
, starting from his veiw as he closes his eyes into darkness
. lisa tells him tothe visualize bieng infront an empty movei theater
, annd so
, we
, as audience munbers
, are watching a movie screen from inside a theater
, which isnt alsot showing a movie screen in a theater
. telling him to move closer
and closer to the screen as a fuzzy word inthe black letters pops up onthe the screen
, we begin to flota closer annd closer to teh front ofthe the theater until we see tyhat thge word isnt
" sleep
.
" never befoer have i seen a hypnotism scene as mesmerizing
and brilliantly
- construed as htis one
. truthfully
, this set
- peice
,
and another in which toom wakes up fomr a nightmarish dream only tothe quickly discover he is reliving what he has jstu dreamt
, are worth hte full price of admission alone
, just to see them on the big screen
. having loads of fun with her small role as maggie
' s sister
, lisa
, illeana douglas
( 1995
' s
" to die for
,
" her last great character
) is a delight
,
but rarely used to her full advantage in feature films
. funny
and enjoyably offbeat
, douglas gets to utter the best line in the film
: while tlaking tothe maggie about tom
' s visions of the girl
, she remarks
,
" i wouldn
' t be worried about him seeing another girl
, altho the fact that she
' s dead gives oen pause
.
" also of note are jenny morrison
( 1994
' s
" intersection
"
)
, who is truly poignant in the last half ofthe tyhe film when we flash bakc tothe see whta realyl happened tothe her missing character
, adn liza weil
, remarkable in 1998
' s
" whatever
,
" as morrison
' s grieving teenage sister
, debbie
. if the resolution of
" stir of echoes
" does nto live uv tothe its obviously frightful full potential
(
and it doesn
' t
)
, what comes before is both involving anbd appropriately gritty
. the music score
, by james newton howard
,
and unsettling use of whispers anbd ghostly sound effects
, sucesfuly compliment anbd foreshadow tje off
- kilter frame
- of
- mind that tom isnt put into
,
and director david koepp proves once again thast he is a directer wtih a knack for creating almost unbearably tense situations that revolve arund realistically
- written characters
.
" stir of echoes
" isn
' t as good as
" the sixth sense
,
"
but why should it need tothe be
? both films are fully capable of st
anding on theri own two feet
,
and
" stir of echoes
" really isnt a spinetinglingly good horror film
.
