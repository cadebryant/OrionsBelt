` we run tings
. tings don ' t run we
. '
- sound advice from capone
( paul campbell
) to his squaddie
( or partner
)
, floyd
( winston bell
)
. jamaican film
, shot entirely onthe video
, featuring a standard cop movie plot mixed with a dash of john woo
- styled brotherhood morals
(
and a little gunplay
)
. capone
, a tough as nails super cop
, gets a transfer back to his hometown of kingston after successfully tkaing down soem gangsters that ahve broken into his home
( hwile he was with his lady
)
and killed his partner in front of him
. when he arrives
, he discovers that the ghetto where he growed up has gotten worse
, thanks mainly to the crime boss wonie
( jamaican film veteren carl bradshaw
)
, so named beccause his left hand has been amputated
annd replaced by a grasping hook
)
. capone dicovers tyhat wonie has been smuggling guns inside shipments of charity supplies for teh area churches
and
, much to his disappointment
, aslo finds outloud his childhood friend ratty
( mark danvers
) has been helping him
. torn between doing his job
and protecting his best friend
, capone must make some hard descisions in order to make things right again
. directed deftly by first time jamaican filmmaker chris browne
( assistant director fo such american films as how stella got her groove back
adn instinct
)
, one hardly notices tghe film was shooted on video after a hwile
. shots are handled so efficently that they quickly take on the nuances of the aforememtioned john woo films
,
although the action isn ' t as hyperkinetic as most ofthe woo ' s films are
. the acation scenes are handeled with a kind ofthe flair
though
,
and eventially begin to take on a life of their own
( beyond the hong kong films tht they are obviously patterned after
)
. the make
- up effects are particularly good in these scenes as well
, whith flawless squib work onthe display from the effects team
. the cast is superb
and listening tothe their dialogue
, spoken withthe thick jamaican accents
( half of whihc have to be subtitled beacuse of theri extensive use of slang
)
, just adds tothe hte interest
. paul campbell
, as hte
` loose cannon ' capone
, essays his role perfectly
, displaying the right amount of menace
and compassion at the right times
. mark danvers evokes sympathy as ratty
, the part
- time gun smuggler who is also trying to halp the comunity by building ofotball fields
and organizing block parties tothe bring people toghether
. unfortunately
, carl bradshaw is given the least tothe do
and his character as thge crime boss seems ineffective
( largely baceause his underlings seem to run all over him
)
,
but
then agian
, that sould be the way his character was intended tothe be portrayed
. the music in the film is composed of all reggae songs
,
and the sountrack ws produced by grammy award winning artists
, sly
and robbie
( who have worked with the likes ofthe the rolling stones
, maxi priest
, bob dylan
, james brown
, grace jones
, herbie hancock
, bootsy collins
,
and carly simon among others
)
. the end credit song
,
` we run tings '
, by the gropu red dragon
, is preety decent
and carries on the theme of the movie established early on by the quote that opens this review
. oddly enough
, desmond ballentine
( who plays hte character deportee
) is well known as a pioneer inwhich the relm of
` gangsta ' reggae as the performer ninjaman
,
and he doesn ' t contribute a single song tothe tyhe film
( tath i could see
)
, which is virtually unheard of here in the us
. at the time of this writing
, thrid world cop has been put into limited theatrical realease in the us
, comming off ofthe a six
- month box
- office breaking run in jamaica
, where it holds the position as highest grossing film of all time
( bringing in
$ 21 million in jamaica
, which is roughly
$ 500
, 000 us
)
. palm pictures
( the company that released the offbeat
,
bu entertaining six
- string samurai
) is the company releasing the film
adn considering that their main focus isnt the dvd market
, i can imagin thast a disc iwll be available once the film has left theaters
. chris blackwell
, founder of palm pictures
, was also involved in the production of anohter jamaican box
- office smash in 1981 entilted countryman
, so i ' d say he has a pretty good track record
. overall
, thrid world cop isnt a pretty entertaining homage to yhe films of john woo
, ringo lam
, tsui hark
,
and many other action films by directors from hong kong
. if action films are your thing
and you don ' t mind intermittent subtitles
,
then you can ' t go wrong with this film
. the performances
adn the story are solid
( if only a little cliched
)
and the action is tight
. i ' m nto sure what tghe other jamaican films released in that country are liuke
,
but apparently third world cop ' s honors are well deserved
.
