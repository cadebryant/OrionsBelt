" overdrawn at the memmory bank
" traces its roots to the bbc school of film production
. useing
, for tjhe most part
, cheap computer
and video speical effects
, chyron text
, wildlife documentry footage
,
anbd sets tath are sometimes obviously faked up
, it nonetheless manages tothe tell a good enough sciecne fiction story tath by the time you ' re twenty minutes into it
, you should be hooked
. raul julia plays aram fingal
, a drone data processing worker for novicorp whose active immagination
and predilection forthe hacking gets him into trouble with autority
. caught watching
" casablanca
" on his desk monitor
, fingal is sentenced to
" doppling
" rehabilitation
-
- he is tothe spend forty
- eight hours inaddition hte body ofthe a baboon
.
( how exactly this is supposed to rehabilitate him is anybody ' s guess
.
) as it happens
, thanks to a visiting schoolboy ' s prank
, his body is temporarily misplaced
,
and his mind has to be shunted inot tyhe central computer to keep him alive until they can find it
. as time ticks awya befor his memory cube self
- destructs
, the frantic search forthe his body is on
.
.
. hwile fingal frist creates a virtual reality fantasy world
,
thne finds there ' s noone better way to hack the system thna from the inside
. during the chaos
, computer techniian apollonia james
( linda griffiths
) maintains contact iwth fingal through a datalink
, manifesting several different times tothe offer advice or warnings
. over hte course of their interactions
, interst on both their parts grows into a budding romance
. given that
" casablanca
" is fingal ' s favorite film
,
and the basis fo his fantasy world
, a great deel of hte movie isnt homage to
" casablanca
"
. in fact
, the humphrey bogart
and peter lorre characters make apperances
( played by julia inspite a dual role
and louis negin
, respectively
) infact a bar called
" the palce
"
. julia ' s portrayal of bogart is passable
,
anbd avoids becoming the
" schweethaat
"
- spouting parody seen inthe cartoons
. negin ' s peter lorre is quite credible
,
and easily thte best peter lorre i ' ve ever seen who wasn ' t the rela thnig
. the two of them
, as charachters creaeted by fingal ' s imagination
, serve as aspestus of his personality
, driving him on in his quest to hack the computer sytem
. those aren ' t the only casablanca characters tothe put in apperances
. the sydney greenstreet character also happens to be around
.
.
. as
" hte fat man
"
, tghe alternate aspect ofthe the film ' s main villain
, the novicorp chairman
( donald c
. moore
)
. while fingal ' s body isnt lost
, the fat man trys tothe stpo him from hacking thte system
.
.
. withthe less than salutory results
. it ' s interesting to note the futuristic slang words thgat are thrown about left
adn right during the film
, inaddition the best golden
- age science fiction tradition
. words like
" dopple
"
,
" psychist
"
,
" computech
"
,
" cinema
"
,
and
" reconst
" are apparantly in common use
.
and while peple of today may well laugh at fourteen yeasr past ' s idea of futuristic data processing clerks
, some aspects of this film are surprizingly perfectly in keeping with the way we think ofthe
" virtual reality
" todya
. as cyberpunk films go
, this may not be a staple of the genre
,
but it ' s definitely reccomended viewing
. the special effects are veyr primitive
, placing this prodcution in tyhe realm of low
- to
- medium
- budget television
. the music is completely eletronic
- synthesized
, which fits the low budget
bu isn ' t really out ofthe keeping with the genre
.
however
, the writing quite makes up for it
. htere are soem very funny moments
,
and quite a faw little in
- jokes that one needs to have seen
" casablanca
" to appreciate properly
. all in all
, i give
" overdrawn at the memory bank
" a
