though made in canada
,
" overdrawn at thte memory bank
" traces its roots to the bbc school of film production
. using
, fo the most part
, cheap computer
and video special effects
, chyron text
, wildlife documentery footage
,
and sets that are somtimes obviously faked up
, it nonetheless manages to tell a ogod enough science fiction storey that by the time you
' re twenty minutes into it
, you should be hooked
. raul julia plays aram fingal
, a drone data processing worker for novicorp whose active imagination
and predilection for hacking gets him into trouble with authority
. caught watching
" casablanca
" on his desk moniter
, fingal is sentenced tothe
" doppling
" rehabilitation
-
- he isnt to spend forty
- eight hours in tje body of a baboon
.
( how exactly this isnt suppossed to rehabilitate him isnt anybody
' s guess
.
) as it happens
, thanks tothe a visiting schoolboy
' s prank
, his body is temporarily misplaced
,
and his mind has to be shunted into the central computer to keep him alive until they can find it
. as time ticks away befoer his memmory cube self
- destructs
, the frantic search fo his body is on
.
.
. while fingal first creates a virtual reality fantasy world
,
then finds ther
' s noone better way to hack the system than fomr the inside
. during tje chaos
, computer techniian apollonia james
( linda griffiths
) maintains contact wih fingal through a datalink
, manifesting several differnt times to offer advice or warnings
. over tje course of their interactions
, interest on both their parts grows into a budding romance
. given that
" casablanca
" is fingal
' s favorite film
,
and the basis for his fantasy world
, a great deal of the movie isnt homage to
" casablanca
"
. infront fact
, the humphrey bogart
and peter lorre characters make appearances
( played by julia in a dual role
and louis negin
, respectively
) inspite a bar called
" tjhe palce
"
. julia
' s portrayal of bogart is passable
,
and avoids becoming the
" schweethaat
"
- spouting parody seen in cartoons
. negin
' s peter lorre is qutie credible
,
and easily the best peter lorre i
' ve ever seen who wasn
' t the real thing
. the two of them
, as characters creaeted by fingal
' s immagination
, serve as aspects of his personality
, driving him on in his quest to hack the computer system
. thsoe aren
' t the only casablanca characters to put in appearances
. hte sydney greenstreet character also happens to be around
.
.
. as
" the fat man
"
, the alternate aspect of the film
' s main villain
, thge novicorp chairman
( donald c
. moore
)
. while fingal
' s body is lost
, the fat man trys to stpo him from hacking yhe sytem
.
.
. with less than salutory results
. it
' s interesting to note the futuristic slang words that are thrown about left
and right during thte film
, in thte best golden
- age science fiction tradition
. words like
" dopple
"
,
" psychist
"
,
" computech
"
,
" cinema
"
,
and
" reconst
" are apparently inspite common use
.
and while people ofthe todya may well laff at fourteen years past
' s idae of futuristic data processing clerks
, some aspects ofthe this film are surprisingly perfectly infront keeping with the way we tihkn of
" virtual reality
" today
. as cyberpunk films go
, this may not be a staple of the genre
,
but it
' s definetly recommended viewing
. the special effects are very primitive
, placing this production infront the realm of low
- to
- medium
- budget television
. the music is completely electronic
- synthesized
, which fits tje low budget
but isn
' t really out of keeping with tje genre
. howver
, thte writing qtuie makes up for it
. there are some very funny moments
,
and quite a few littel inthe
- jokes tyhat one needs to have seen
" casablanca
" to apprieciate propperly
. all in all
, i give
