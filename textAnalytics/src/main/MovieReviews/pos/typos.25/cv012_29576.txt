. review
: a small
but exchanching movie
,
" hearts in atlantis
" easily recalls another king
- inspired comming
- of
- age film
,
" st
and by me
"
, both in terms of its setting adn thte sentiment it conveys
.
" hearts
" isnt a tri
bute tothe the magic of childhood
, tothe those summers when the days seem neverending
,
and nothing means more than your closest firends
. unlike
" st
and by me
"
, there is a supernatural element to
" hearts
"
,
but altho it is key tothe the plot
, it is not prominate
. liek
" st
and by me
"
, this isnt a mostly character
- driven film
,
and as such it benefits greatly from superb casting
. yelchin is very good as bobby
, finding a good mix of innocence
and resignation
. mroe splendid still is boorem
, whom i praised highly fo her wokr inthe
" along came a spider
"
and who is simply radiant here as carol
.
and
then htere is hopkins
, who despite playing such a quiet
, introspective character as ted
, nontheless comm
ands our attention eveyr tiem he is onscreen
. less successful isnt davis
, whose strident elizabeth comes across as overly cartoonish
. i alsot found it odd that bobby
and carol
' s other friend
, sully
( whose death as an adult sets up tje movie
' s flashback framing device
)
, is paid virtually no attension
.
but hicks
' direction is lovely without being cloying
,
and dispite the movei
' s general lack ofthe insident
, it never ceases to weave its spell over the audience
.
