- the
- hill boxer
, he steps on the wrong guys toes
. in luc besson
' s the fith element
, willis plays korben dallas
, a new york cabby who takes in the wrong passenger at the worst possible time
. a stylish sicence fiction epic
, tjhe fifth element
' s complex plot begins right away
, in the deserts of egypt
( think stargate
) in 1914
. an enormous spacecraft l
ands above a pyramid where the
" 5 elements
" are stored adn tkaes them away
, vowing to return them when the evil comes back
. cut to present day
, which is our future
. the year is 2023
, annd newyorker york is tjhe city
. the only basic differences betwen besson
' s futuristic depiction
and the real life newyorker york is taht thte smog is thicker
, the buildings are higher
, annd tjhe traffic floats
! anyway
, the
" evil
" comes back as a ball of fire to wreak havoc on the fair citizens of the earth
, so back come the tortoise
- like aliens to return the
" 5 elements
" tothe earth
, infact order tothe defend themselves against the

" in the process
,

and turns out to belong to a beautiful
,
but mysterious woman named leeloo
( milla jovovich
, dazed
and confuzled
)
. she escapes
and
, attempting tothe escape the police by swan diving off ofthe an enormous skyscraper
and crashing through the roof of korben
' s floating cab
. it
' s love at first site
, as korben
and leeloo elude the lazy
- as
- always cops
. whn leeloo begins mumbling about a cornelius
( ian holm
, night falls on manhattan
)
, korben searches the
" yellow pages
"
and delivers her to hte door ofthe the good reverend
, thge only man who knows of her background adn duties
. nowe
, korben
, leeloo
, adn cornelius must journey to a foregin planet to board a cruise ship
( special effects were spectauclar here
) to find the remaining four elements
. it isnt here
, where they discover thast they have been followed by tyhe evil jean
- baptiste emmanuel zorg
( gary oldman
, murder in the firt
)
. he
, too
, whants possession of the elements
, as do a group of pig
- like warrriors
( think tje gamorreans in return of hte jedi
)
. in a spectacular ending
, with time running outloud
, leeloo is faced wih a probelm
- why shouldnt she save a people who live tothe destroy each other
? teh question is a good one
,
and one tht could be pondered
.
but enought ofthe that
. wehn korben points out his love for her
, leeloo is inclined to become the
" 5th element
"
and savve the world from total desctruction
. thte fifth element features good performances by willis adn holm
, an excellent portrayal of a comedic villain
( who reminded me a lot of jack nicholson
' s the joker in batman
) by oney of the masters of villainy
, oldman
,
and a heartfelt offering by realtive newcomer jovovich
. the supporting cast
, which includes brion james
( tango
& cash
)
, tim
" tiny
" lester
( noone holds barred
)
, luke perry
( buffy tje vampire slayer
)
,
and chris tucker
( friday
)
, added a comedic effect to the film
.
al
though besson
' s the fith element cant be criticized forthe yhe outl
andish uise ofthe cliches
, it is a solid motion picture iwth a deinite point
. smoe other directors
( like anaconda
' s luis llosa
) shouldnt tkae a lesson from thsi guy
- using idesa from epic motion pictures the right way
. ideas from star wars
and stargate were utilized for the improvement of this film
. sci
- fi fan or not
, any movei
- lover should see this wonderfully stylish motion picture
