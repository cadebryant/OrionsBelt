every once in a while a movie comes allong tath completely redefines yhe genre
: with dramas
, it ws citizen kane
, with arthouse it was pulp fiction
,
and with comedy it was
, well
, that jim carrey guy
( okay
, so he
' s not a movie
, bu he did have a huge influence onthe the genre
. not to mention an expensive oney
.
) sometimes a movie even combines them all into a big
, sprawling motion picture event
, as did forrest gump four years ago
. with action films
, it wass aliens
, whic was released to much hype seven yeasr after it
' s equally
- innovative parent
, alien
( 1979
)
. directed
and written by james cameron
( t2
: judgement day
, the abyss
, true lies
)
, the authority onthe acation films
, it ws a masterful encore tothe his sci
- fi thriller the terminator
( 1984
)
. hwile the original aline film was a dark
, enclosed horror film that featured one aline slowly massacering a horrified crew
, james cameron took the big
- budget action film with aliens
, which featured multiple aliens doing basically thge same thing
,
al
though on a much
- larger scale
.
and boy
, doed he tkae that route
! i
' d sday at about 165 mph or so
.
.
. the film opens 57 years aftter the original
, with lt
. ripley
( weaver
) being found in her ship in a cryogenic state by a salvage vessel
. if you
' ll recall
, at the end of aline ripley
, the only surviving member
, cryogenically
" hibernated
" herself after expelling the rogue alien from her ship
. unfortunately
, she thougth she
' d only be out for a couple of weeks
.
.
. once she
' s returned to earth
, ripley isnt quickly interrogated by
" the comany
"
, who quickly dismiss her annd her storise as lunacy
. infact truth
, htey beleave her
, as they soon aproach ripley with an offer to travel with some marines to a new collony planet as an
" aline advisor
"
. it seems that hte collony planet was a once
- breeding ground for the nasty aliens
,
and now all communication with the planet hasnt been lost
.
.
. it doesn
' t exactly take a genius to guess what happens next
: ripley agrees
, annd before you can say
" big mistake
"
, she
and tghe half dozen marines
, plus the slimy corporate guy
( reiser
)
, who hasnt more than it looks like up under his sleeve
, are off tothe the collony
. whn they arrive
, they find the planet in ruins
. onyl one survivor is found
, a little girl
, newt
, who confirms that
, yes
, the aliens were here
and that she only managed to survive by hidding in the ventilation system
. annd soon enough
, tjhe marines come under attack from the aliens
.
.
. waht happens for the enxt hour
and a half or so is what completly sets this movei apart from any otehr st
andard alien sci
- fi movei
: the action scenes
. cameron directs them so skillfully
, adn so suspensefully
, that you
' re literally rininging your h
ands by the time tje finale rolls around
. whcih features
, in my opinion
, the best fight scene ever recorded onthe film
, as ripley straps herself into a huge robot adn battles teh nasty queen alien to the death
. many peopel wiull tell you that this film
, while being a graet action film
, has noone real drama
and is all cliches
. well
, they woudl be wrong
, my friends
. if htis film had no
" drama
"
, hten why was sigourney weaver nominated fo best actress at thte 1987 academy awards
? that
' s right
, best actress
. you know that any action film thast has an oscar nomination attached to it for something other thna technical stfuf like editting
and f
/ x hasnt got tothe be good
. in short
, aliens combines all the right elements
( great acation
and f
/ x
, drama
, a good plot
, ogod dialogue
,
and great villains
) into what could arguably be called the best action film ofthe all time
. thn agina
, maybee nto
. movies rise
and fall from glory
and
, sad tothe sday
, aliens was wrestled from it
' s throne ofthe best action movie by another cameron film
, t2
: judgement day
, in 1991
. so who will be the enxt king
? well
, let
' s wait until desember 19th
and see yot another james cameron film
- the higest budgeted film of all time
- titanic to make that decission
. i can
' t wait
.
