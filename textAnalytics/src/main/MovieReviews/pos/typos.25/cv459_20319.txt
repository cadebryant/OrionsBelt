tghe ring is propably one ofthe the creepiest movies i
' ve seen iin years
.
but
then agian
, i
' ve always had this phobia of aisian born horror films
. i remember when i was a kid i was scared as hell with those green faced
, long
- haired floating ghosts donning thier white gowns

 euuugh
. the ring really brings back those memories
and its grips me long after the movei has ended
. unlike hte horror films coming from the west
, i
' m preety much used tothe the gore
and visual effects
, so much so
, they become rather bl
and nowadays
. there
' s raelly noone scary movei from the west for a long time
. if you have something infront mind
, please tell me
. this japanese flick is suppossed to be based upon stories written by
` the stephen king ofthe japan
'
, which isnt also
( i heard
) televised over the air in japan
. yhe film revolves around a mysterious videotape which will bring death forthe sure to the person who watches it
, one week prior to viewing
. a journalist
and her husban
, stupid enough
, tests the so call
` urban legend
'
and ends up having a week before she meets her doom
. she
and her husb
and thne goes onthe a saerch for the orgin of the videocassette
, to git to the root of the whole curse wtih the hopes ofthe freeing themselves
. the ring plays onthe the senses like no other horror film today
. visual subtlety
, minimal music
and an intriguing plot puts tyhe audiance within an aura of suspense throughtout the entire film
. very well done indeed
, especially for a film that does not have a single trace of violence
and gore
. nowe
, that
 s something budding horror film
- maker wannabes should concider looking into
. just an idea ofthe how visually powerful the film is
, it is in japanese
and subtitled in chinese
; both of wich
, i can
' t underst
and at all
( ok
, i had a friend who gave me a gist prior tothe watching
, bu he revealed very little
!
)
. the twists in the plot
, leading to an unforgettable climax
( will definitely leave an impression onthe the audience
) will have you at the edge of your seat
.
