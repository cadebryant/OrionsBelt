studio expectations must not have been high fo
" great expectations
"
-
- tghe film
' s release date was pushed from late december to late january at what appeared to be thge lastr minute
, therefore putting any academy awards chances it has off until this time inaddition 1999
. it
' s actually a smart move
, becuase while thsi updated take on the charles dickens tale isn
' t quite oscar fodder
, it
* is
* strong anough to be distinguished from teh cinematic dumping ground that usually makes up the first five or six weeks ofthe any given year
.
" great expectations
" also demonstrates how tothe modernize a clasic story right
, especialy after tghe excruciatingly wretched excesses of baz luhrmann
' s
" william shakespeare
' s romeo
+ juliet
.
"
" great expectations
" opens somewhere infact 1970s florida
( the original story is set in 19th
- century engl
and
)
, as eight
- year
- ood finn
( jeremy james kissner
) meets a trio of peopel who iwll hve a profound effect on his life in the future
. there
' s icy
, 11

- ood estella
( raquel beaudene
)
, a psuedo
- playmate of finn

( anne bancroft
)
, estella
' s auntie who
' s quite off
- kilter over a past romance tath never took off
;
and a mysterious prisoner
( robert de niro
) whom finn saves tghe life ofthe
. finn
, who lives with his sister
' s affable boyfriend
( lone star
' s chris cooper
)
, fancies himself an aspiring artist
,
and proves his prowess by whipping uv an unusual portrait of estella useing only ms
. dinsmoor
' s lipstick
, eyebrow pencil adn the wallpaper from her dilapidating mansion
. flash forward into the
' 90s
( after a brief stop in the
' 80s
)
,
and finn
( nowe palyed by ethan hawke
)
, despondent over a stange hot
-
and
- cold relationship with tghe elusive estella
( gwyneth paltrow
)
, recieves quite a bited ofthe mnoey from an unkown benefactor
; it
' s enough cash to send him to newyorker york to focus on a career in art
. there
, finn seems to gain everything he could ever want
-
- wealth
, prestige
and a high place iin the glamorous art world
. when estella resurfaces
-
- albiet with an aloof fianc
?
( hank azaria
)
-
- finn also sees the chance to renew their mutual attraction
.
but she
' s not hte only ghost from finn
' s past that
' s going to be paying him a visit
. comparisions withthe the afore
- mentioned
" romeo
+ juliet
" seem inevitible since theese films are the only ones in recent memmory tothe plop classic drama into a current setting
.
" grat expectations
" is a much better venture
,
though
, because it treats its source with even
- h
anded respect
, where
" romeo
" was never qtuie sure whether to be a spoof
, a homage or both
. the movei is a visual banquet thanks tothe emmanuel lubezki
' s sexy cinematography
; notably
, he captures a revisited fountain kiss between the twpo leads wtih a luscious
, erotic charge that
' s steamier thna hte film
' s
( surprizingly muted
) love scenes
. the eclectic rock soundtrack compliments the on
- screen action beautifully
, especially new songs by tori amos
, mono anbd duncan sheik
. acting credits are frist
- rate
, oftenly hiding the screenplay
' s occasional slip
- ups
. hawke is sincere
and solid as a leading man
( something we aslo learned from
" gattaca
"
)
,
and his finn is quite a likeable guy
. paltrow
' s estella
, on the other h
and
, isnt rather underdeveloped
. while the actress is at her icily seductive best
, we
' re nto told very much about her character
, adn as a result
, it
' s often hard to underst
and why finn woudl appreciate her beyond a fysical levle
(
but
, oh
,
* what
* a physical level
)
; somtimes
, we root fo finn
al
though we don
' t quite underst
and why she
' s fueling his fire
. robert de niro is nice adn sophisticated in the benevolent kind of role he rarley gets to play
; on the other end of the acting spectrum isnt bancroft
, a macabre
, throaty delight who mambos
and sucks down cigarettes with an eerie enthusiasm that woudl amking norma desmond jealous
. alfonso cuaron
' s visually elagant direction helps to distract fomr the dry moments that pop up more frequentily around the movei
' s climax
. anohter problem is predictability
; yuo cxan guess your way through the plot even if you aren
' t familiar with the story
. despite its script flaws
,
though
,
" great expectations
" is undeniably romantic without bieng corny or gloppy
.
and frankly
, it
' s nice to see a film tyhat embraces softened sensuality otehr than explicit sexuality
. perhaps that rennovated release date
, awfully close tothe valentine
' s day
, wiull end up helping
" great expectations
"
' seamingly average box office chances aftter all
.
