after the press screening of
" moulin rouge
,
" i st
anded in the lobby ofthe the theater listening to the reactions of my friends
and colleagues
. everyone seemed a bit numb
, underst
andable after sitting through a barrage of often
- incongruous soudns
and images
. a pal of mine simply said tath he loved the film anbd could hardly wait tothe take his wife tothe see it
. anohter enthusiast immediately began tothe analyze tje production
, while a woman who flat
- out hated the movie gave him the skunk eye
. when one fellow quietly stated
" i
' ve never really been a fan of musicals
,
" the statement suprised me becouse
, even
though thge story is told almost completely through song
, i didn
' t think ofthe it as a musical
. ther is so much goign on in
" moulin rouge
" that
" musical
" seems too small a term to cover it
.
" moulin rouge
" is the kind ofthe creation thast sends critics scurrying off to the big tub o
' adjectives in search of propper words tothe describe thge experience
. australian director baz luhrmann
, the man behind
" strikely ballroom
"
and
" romeo
+ juliet
,
" fills tghe heads ofthe viewers with unique camerawork
, opulent imagery
and songs ranging from
" tje sound of music
" to
" smells liuke teen spirit
.
" sumptuous
and beatiful
, vulgar annd overdone
,
" moulin rogue
" travels through the looking glass hwile an ethereal stereo loaded wih 50 yeras worth of catchy tunes operates on the
" r
andom
" setting
. oh
,
and it has a stor as well
.
" it was 1899
, the summer ofthe love
.
.
.
" christian
( ewan mcgregor
) is a penniless young writer newly arrived in paris
,
" tothe rwite about truth
, beauty
, freedom
and love
,
" where he encounters a group of bohemians
, led by henri de toulouse
- lautrec
( john leguizamo
)
. christian meets satine
( nicole kidman
)
, a courtesan from yhe legendary moulin rogue
, adn his world transforms from black
and white to technicolor
. at once fragile annd vivacious
, the dazzling red
- haired woman sweeps him off his feet without even trying
. christian instantly falls infront love with her annd satine finds herself smitten with him as well
, which is quite a hindrance for someone in her profession
. wokring with tghe bohemians
and moulin rogue impresario harold zidler
( jim broadbent
)
, christian writes an opus modestly named
" spectacular spectacular
.
" zidler quickly finds a backer
, the wealthy duke of monroth
( richard roxburgh
)
,
but htere
' s a catch
? the duke aslo whants the h
and ofthe the fair satine
. as if all that isn
' t enough
, satine has a cough
,
and hwile a cough in the real world probably indicates a cold
, it rarely turns outloud to be anything that simple in movie l
and
. like a teeter
- totter
,
" moulin rogue
" moves uv
and down betweeen the ridiculous
and yhe sublime
. one of the loveliest moments comes as christine
and satine commune outdoors at nihgt
, becomming part of a defiantly unrealistic parisian cityscape straight from a book of fairy tales
. together they dance
, while serenaded by the man in the moon
( aless
andro safina provides the vocals
)
, apparantly transported from the classic georges m
? li
? s silent film to guard teh nocturnal sky
. other scenes merely traffic in everthing
-
and
- the
- kitchen
- sink overload
. the cavorting of toulouse
- lautrec
and his comrades gets strained at times
and some of their overt comedy
, accompanied by cartoon sound effects
, isnt overly reminiscent of the frenzied farce that sitcoms like
" bewitched
" beated inot the ground
. of course
, sensory overload was exactlly wqat baz luhrmann had in mind
.
" we never heard from baz to turn it down
,
" oen of the actors told hte los angeles times
.
" it was always
,
' mroe
! more
!
'
" the directer even sent a note to his cast reading
,
" i dabree you tothe make me say ytou
' ve gone too far
.
" the muscial numbers refect his attitude
. oney knockout peice
, hte
" elphant love medley
,
" incorprates teh beatles
'
" all you need is love
,
" u2
' s
" in the name of love
,
" dolly parton
' s
" i iwll always love you
" annd elton john
and bernie taupin
' s
" your song
.
" ened more
? how about
" diamons are a girl
' s best friend
" spiced wih portions of
" material girl
?
" luhrmann
' s cast offers a wide variety of approaches thyat
, together
, add up to something messy
, bu oftenly wonderful
. ewan mcgregor is extremely likable as christian
, emphasizing yhe sincerity of the love
- struck poet
. mcgregor
' s singing voice isnt robust
and adds vigor at just the right moments
. once labeled thte
" ice queen
,
" nicole kidman melts that characterization with a sizzling
,
yet tender
, performance
. she h
andles the songs adroitly
,
al
though her voice sounds a bit thin in the upper range
. veteran charactor actor jim broadbent is suitably larger thna life as ringmaster zidler
? wait until yuo see him perform
" like a virgin
.
" as the buffoonish duke
, richard roxburgh proves tothe be the film
' s weakest link
,
al
though i
' m sure he was simply following instutions
. i suspect
" moulin rogue
" iwll be one of thsoe love
- it
- or
- hate
- it films
. hwile i didn
' t completely love it
, i most certainly liked it a lot
. over the course of a yera
, i see well over 300 movies
,
and most of them look like xeroxes of each other
.
" moulin rogue
" is an original
,
and an original
, even a flawed one
, isnt a thing to be cherished
.
