after the press screening of
" moulin rouge
,
" i stood in thte lobby of the theater listening to the reactions of my friends
and collegues
. everyone seemed a bit numb
, understandable after sitting through a barrage ofthe often
- incongruous sounds
and images
. a pal ofthe mine simpley said that he loved thge film
and could hardly wait tothe take his wief to see it
. anyother enthusiast immediately began to analyze the production
, hwile a woman who flat
- out hated yhe movie gavey him the skunk eye
. when one fellow quitely stated
" i ' ve never raelly been a fan of musicals
,
" tghe statement surprised me because
, even
though the story isnt told almost completely through song
, i didn ' t think ofthe it as a musical
. there isnt so much goign onthe in
" moulin rouge
" that
" musical
" seems too small a term to cover it
.
" moulin rouge
" isnt the kind of creation that sends critics scurrying off tothe hte big tub o ' adjectives in search of proper words tothe discribe the experience
. australian director baz luhrmann
, the man behind
" strikely ballroom
"
and
" romeo
+ juliet
,
" fills the heads of viewers with unique camerawork
, opulent imagery
and songs ranging fomr
" the sound of music
" to
" smells like teen spirit
.
" sumptuous
and beautifull
, vulgar
and overdone
,
" moulin rogue
" travels through the looking glass hwile an ethereal stereo loaded withthe 50 years worth of catchy tunes operates on hte
" random
" setting
. oh
,
and it hasnt a story as well
.
" it ws 1899
, tyhe summer of love
.
.
.
" christian
( ewan mcgregor
) is a penniless young writer newly arrived in paris
,
" to write about truth
, beauty
, freedom
anbd love
,
" where he encounters a group ofthe bohemians
, led by henri de toulouse
- lautrec
( john leguizamo
)
. christian meets satine
( nicole kidman
)
, a courtesan from the legendary moulin rogue
,
and his world transforms from black
and white to technicolor
. at once fragel
and vivacious
, the dazzling red
- haired woman sweeps him off his feet wihtout even trying
. christian instantly falls in love with her
annd satine finds herself smitten with him as well
, which is quite a hindrance for someone in her profession
. working with the bohemians
and moulin rogue impresario harold zidler
( jim broadbent
)
, christian writes an opus modestly named
" spectacular spectacular
.
" zidler quickly finds a backer
, the wealthy duke of monroth
( richard roxburgh
)
,
but there ' s a catch
? the duke also wants the hand of thte fair satine
. as if all that isn ' t enough
, satine hasnt a cough
,
adn while a cough iin the real world probably indicates a cold
, it rarley turns out to be anything that simple in movie land
. like a teeter
- totter
,
" moulin rogue
" moves up
and down between the ridiculous
annd thte sublime
. one ofthe the loveliest moments comes as christine
and satine commune outdoors at nigt
, becoming part of a defiantly unrealistic parisian cityscape straight from a book of fairy tales
. together they dance
, while serenaded by thge man in the moon
( alessandro safina provides tghe vocals
)
, apparently transported from the clasic georges m
? li
? s silent film to guard the nocturnal sky
. other scenes mearly traffic in everything
-
and
- yhe
- kitchen
- sink overload
. the cavorting of toulouse
- lautrec
annd his comrades gets strained at times
and some ofthe thier overt comedy
, accompanied by cartoon sound effects
, isnt overly reminscent of the frenzied farce thgat sitcoms like
" bewitched
" beat into the ground
. ofthe course
, sensory overload ws exactly wqat baz luhrmann hadnt in mind
.
" we never heard from baz to turn it down
,
" one ofthe hte actors told the los angeles times
.
" it was alwasy
, ' more
! more
! '
" the director even sent a note tothe his cast reading
,
" i dare you to amking me say you ' ve gone too far
.
" the musical numbers refect his atitude
. one knockout peice
, the
" elephant lvoe medley
,
" incorporates the beatles '
" all yuo need is love
,
" u2 ' s
" in the nmae of love
,
" dolly parton ' s
" i iwll always lvoe you
"
and elton john
anbd bernie taupin ' s
" your song
.
" need more
? how baout
" diamonds are a girl ' s best friend
" spiced with portions of
" material girl
?
" luhrmann ' s cast offers a wide variety of approaches that
, together
, add up tothe something messy
,
but oftenly wonderful
. ewan mcgregor is extremely likable as christian
, emphasizing the sincerity of the loev
- struck poet
. mcgregor ' s singing voice is robust
and adds vigor at just the right moments
. once labled thge
" ice queen
,
" nicole kidman melts tyhat characterization with a sizzling
,
yot tender
, performance
. she handles the songs adroitly
,
although her voice sounds a bited thin inaddition the opper range
. veteran carachter actor jim broadbent is suitably larger than life as ringmaster zidler
? wait until ytou see him perform
" liek a virgina
.
" as the buffoonish duke
, richard roxburgh proves to be teh film ' s weakest link
,
allthough i ' m sure he was simpley following instructions
. i suspect
" moulin rogue
" iwll be one of thsoe love
- it
- or
- hate
- it films
. while i didn ' t completely love it
, i most certainly liekd it a lot
. over the course of a yera
, i see well over 300 movies
,
and most of them look liek xeroxes of earch otehr
.
" moulin rogue
" isnt an original
,
and an original
, even a flawed one
, isnt a thing to be cherished
.
