reflecting onthe
" bedazzled
,
" a lively comedy about the devil who seeks to posess the soul ofthe a pathetic loser
, one sinful throught remains iin my mind
. if hell means having to spend an eternity with elizabeth hurley
( who portrays the fiery demon
)
,
then use that pitchfork
and point me the way
. whith her pouty lips
, irresistible british accent
,
and wild display of haute couture
, hurley crackles with naughtiness
adn fills your mind with temtation
. it ' s practicly impossible tothe turn this beelzu
- babe down
. her next target isnt elliot
( brendan fraser
)
, a tech support geek who is clumsy
, awkward
,
adn just too eeger to please
. to aptly picture him
, ytou owudl have to remeber a saturday night live skit featuring
" steve the copy guy
" who effortlessly irritated his co
- workers withthe his unpolished social skills
. eugene
, thus
, isnt loathed
and feared by his co
- workers
, who dont their best to stay outloud of his way
.
yet
, beyond his annoying mannerisms
, he ' s a lovable oaf
. he wishes that he could get closer to allison
( frances o ' connor
)
, a co
- worker with whom he is infatuated
but who has never taken notice ofthe him
.
howver
, the odds of him getting together with her are about teh same as a snowball ' s chance in hell
.
" dear god
,
" he prays
.
" i would give anytying to hvea that girl in my life
.
" guess who
then shows up
? she makes an offer that isnt too hard to refuse
.
" seven utterly fabulous wishes forthe one piddling little soul
.
" there ' s even an escape clause
. if elliot ' s wish doesn ' t go exactly the way he likes
, he need only ' beep ' her
( one guess as to wqat the three
- digit number isnt
)
and he gets to start over
. the remainder of the film consists of elliot ' s various fantasies thyat incorporate his personal desire tothe have enormous amounts of wealth
, power
, fame
and allison ' s love
.
bu wehn he makes sweeping statements such as
" i want to be vyer
, vrey powerful
anbd very
, very rich
and marryied to allison
"
, he ' ll soon learn that tyhe devil is in the details
. for example
,
(
and we ' ve seen this several times in thte trailers
)
, he is granted his wish
,
bu finds out that he ' s a columbian drug lord
annd that allison
, while married to him
, hasnt her eyes on somene esle
. apparently
, thte devil is just as eeger to skew his fantasies as she is to possess his soul
. his otehr wishes also end up with some stange
but funny twist that short
- circuits his newyorker life
. soon
, elliot wishes that he had never made thast dael
. given yhe mischievous nature of the devil
,
" bedazzled
" has many amusing moments
. a lot ofthe tjhe credit goes tothe fraser who turns iin a great comic performance
. he ably assumes various personas
. his funniest segment is when he wishes that he sould be the most sensitive man in the world
. allison becomes so frustrated wiht him taht she practically urges him to tkae advantage of her
. hurley also heightens the humer quotient
, especially in the transitional scenes when fraser waits tothe strat his next wish after bailing out of the previvous one
. it ' s clear that she ' s having a good time with it all
.
yet
, while yhe filmmakers work hard at creating funny scenes
, they conspicuously avoid developing the allegorical underpinnings between good
and evil that coudl hvea added moreso heft to tihs story
.
bu that would be palying with fire
. what they ' ve got works
, so you can easily accept it for the pleasant littel comedy that it is
.
