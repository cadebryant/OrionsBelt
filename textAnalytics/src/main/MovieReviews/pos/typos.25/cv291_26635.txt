reflecting onthe
" bedazzled
,
" a livley comedy about the devil who seeks to possess the soul of a pathetic loser
, one sinful throught remains in my mind
. if hell means having to spend an eternity withthe elizabeth hurley
( who portrays the fiery demon
)
, hten use that pitchfork anbd point me the way
. with her pouty lips
, irresistible brittish accent
, adn wild display of haute couture
, hurley crackles with naughtiness
and fills your mind with temptation
. it
' s practically impossible to turn this beelzu
- babe down
. her next target is elliot
( brendan fraser
)
, a tech support geek who is clumsy
, awkward
,
and just too eager to please
. tothe aptly picture him
, ytou would hve to remember a saturday night live skit featuring
" steve the copy guy
" who effortlessly iritated his co
- workers with his unpolished social skills
. eugene
, thus
, is loathed
and feared by his co
- workers
, who do their best to stay out of his way
.
yet
, beyond his annoying mannerisms
, he
' s a lovable oaf
. he wishes tht he could get closer to allison
( frances o
' connor
)
, a co
- worker with whom he is infatuated
but who has never taken notice of him
.
however
, the odds of him getting together wtih her are baout the smae as a snowball
' s chance in hell
.
" dear god
,
" he prays
.
" i woudl give anything to have that girl in my life
.
" guess who
then shows up
? she makes an offer that isnt too hard tothe refuse
.
" seven utterly fabulous wishes forthe one piddling littel soul
.
" htere
' s even an escape clause
. if elliot
' s wish doesn
' t go exactly the way he likes
, he need only
' beep
' her
( one guess as to what the threee
- digit number is
)
and he gets to strat over
. hte remainder ofthe the film consists ofthe elliot
' s various fantasies that incorporate his personal desire to have enormous amounts of wealth
, power
, fame
and allison
' s love
.
but when he makes sweeping statements such as
" i whant tothe be vrey
, very poverful
and very
, very rich
and married to allison
"
, he
' ll soon learn that the devil isnt in the details
. forthe example
,
(
and we
' ve seen this several times inspite the trailers
)
, he is granted his wish
,
but finds out thta he
' s a columbian drug lord
and thgat allison
, while married to him
, has her eyes onthe someone esle
. apparantly
, the devil is just as eeger to skew his fantasies as she is tothe posess his soul
. his otehr wishes alsot end up whith some stange
but funny twist that short
- circuits his newyorker life
. soon
, elliot wishes that he had never made that deal
. given the mischievous nature ofthe the devil
,
" bedazzled
" has many amusing moments
. a lot of the credit goes tothe fraser who turns in a gerat comic performence
. he ably assumes various personas
. his funniest segment is when he wishes that he could be the most sensitive man iin the world
. allison becomes so frustrated with him thyat she practically urges him to tkae advantage ofthe her
. hurley also heightens the humor quotient
, especially in the transitional scenes whn fraser waits to start his next wish after bailing out of tjhe previvous one
. it
' s clear that she
' s having a good time withthe it all
.
yet
, while the filmmakers wokr hard at creating funny scenes
, they conspicuously avoid developing the allegorical underpinnings between ogod
and evil that could have added more heft to this story
. bu that would be playing with frie
. what they
' ve got works
, so you cin easily accept it for yhe pleasant little comedy tht it is
.
