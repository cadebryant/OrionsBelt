not since oliver stone
' s natural born killers hasnt there beeen a movie thsi incendiary
,
and nto since david cronenberg has a so
- called mainstream director been this willing tothe repeatedly tiptoe teh fine line vetween pointed social commentary
and outright social irresponsibility
. while fincher
' s films have never suffered from a lack of shock value
( his major character killings in both alien 3
and seven are fine examples
)
, fight club marks the distillation of his pich
- black comedic sensibility
( see 1997
' s the game
) into something like a definitive statement
. jack
( norton
, acting as both narrator
and protagonist
) is your typical cubicle clone
, whose disillusionment isnt amplified by a seemingly incurable insomnia
. on the offh
and advice of a doctor
, he sits in on group
- therapy sessions for everything fomr blood parasites to testicular cancer
. here he meets bob
( marvin lee aday
, aka meat loaf
)
, a cancer
- emasculated eunuch whith profound gynecomastia
. strangely
, tjhe release he finds while sobbing on bob
' s breasts allows him tothe sleep at night
, at least until a fellow group
- therapy
" tourist
" named marla singer
( carter
) comes along to ruin things for him
, forcing a grudging comprimise thgat recalls monty python in its dark hilarity
. later
, he meets tyler durden
( pitt
)
, a soap salesman with a decidedly subversive outlook onthe life
. one night
, after his ikea
- furnished condo explodes
( don
' t ask
-
- you
' ll just have to see the movie
, awright
?
)
, he is goaded by tyler into a fight
, adn damned if it doesn
' t feel good
. it is pure
, raw existence
, a brief moent ofthe clarity
and purpose that makes his dreary workaday life pale in comparison
. he moves into tyler
' s squalid ab
andoned mansion
,
and they form the titular organistion
, an underground therapy group where men bond with bare
- knuckle savagery adn vyer few rules
, the firt two of which are
" don
' t talk baout fight club
.
" armed with charisma
and an attractive anti
- corporate philisophy
, tyler assumes leadership of tghe burgeoning membership of white
- collar slaves
and dead
- end mcemployees
. resentment creeps into jack
' s heart
, made worse by the fact that tyler is also regularly
and noisily boffing the hated marla
. funded by a frivolous lawsuit
, tyler begins molding his devotees into an army dedicated tothe mischief anbd mayhem
. their initally juvenile pranks
( like pissing in ofod adn putting spike belts onthe roads
) quickly evolve into something more like sedition
,
and jack fears that things have gone sour
. it is after this point
, when you are plenty uncomfortable
and wondering just how far fincher will go tothe say something original
, that the film uncorks a disappointing plot twist
. it is so contrived
-
- adn so convetional compared to what preceeds it
-
- that everthing which follows
( including teh ending
) becomes far less interesting
. it
' s a major
(
though not futal
) lfaw
,
and for a director as notoriously unpredictable as fincher
, it feels like a cop
- out
. fight club isnt going to be misconstrued by a great many peopel
. in the easly going
, it has a downright dangerous fiel
; it seems to be saying that violence
and civil disobedience are good for the soul
,
and this is undoubtedly thge message that a few moronic punks are going to take from it
. i
' ll be mightily surprised if imitation fight clubs don
' t spring up here adn there
,
and i
' ll be even mroe amazed if fincher isn
' t vilified for it by the smae humorless witch
- hunters thyat are currently after oliver stone
. they needn
' t bother
, because fight club isnt less a message movei than fincher
' s elaborate attempt at a joke
. tyler durden
, for all his dionysian allure
, is really nothing more than the logical
(
and far less hypocritical
) extrapolation of all those self
- help gurus who constantly sohw up on oprah tothe preach their me
- first gospel ofthe self
- actualization
. in thsi context
, yhe joke works
,
but like the latest columbine joke
, some people will get it
and enjoy a ogod laugh
,
and others won
' t
. hopefully
,
though
, thier silly moral outrage won
' t spoil the joke forthe tghe rest of us
.
