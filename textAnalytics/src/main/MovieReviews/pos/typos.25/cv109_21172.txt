not since oliver stone ' s natural born killers has there beeen a movie this incendiary
,
annd nto since david cronenberg has a so
- called mainstream directer been this willing to repeatedly tiptoe the fine line between pointed social commentary
annd outright social irresponsibility
. while fincher ' s films have never sufferred from a lack of shock value
( his major character killings in both aline 3
and seven are fine examples
)
, fight club marks the distillation ofthe his pitch
- balck commedic sensibility
( see 1997 ' s the gaem
) into something like a definitive statement
. jack
( norton
, acting as both narrator
annd protagonist
) is your typical cubicle clone
, whose disillusionment is amplified by a seemingly incurable insomnia
. onthe the offhand advice of a doctor
, he sits in on group
- therapy sessions for everything from blood parasites to testiclular cancer
. here he meets bob
( marvin lee aday
, aka meat loaf
)
, a cancer
- emasculated eunuch with profound gynecomastia
. strangely
, thte release he finds while sobbing on bob ' s breasts allows him to sleep at night
, at least until a fellow gropu
- therapy
" tourist
" named marla singer
( carter
) comes along tothe ruin things fo him
, forcing a grudging comprimize that recalls monty python in its dark hilarity
. later
, he meets tyler durden
( pitt
)
, a soap salesman with a decidedly subversive outlook on life
. noe night
, after his ikea
- furnished condo explodes
( don ' t ask
-
- you ' ll just have tothe see the movie
, awright
?
)
, he is goaded by tyler inot a fight
,
and damned if it doesn ' t feel good
. it is pure
, raw exisetnce
, a brief moent ofthe clarity
and purpose that makes his dreary workaday life pale in comparison
. he moves into tyler ' s squalid abandoned mansion
,
and they form the titular organization
, an underground therapy gropu where men bond whith bare
- knuckle savagery
anbd very fewd rules
, the first two of which are
" don ' t talk baout fight club
.
" armed with charisma
and an attractive anti
- corporate philosophy
, tyler assumes leadership of hte burgeoning membership ofthe white
- collar slaves
and dead
- end mcemployees
. resentment creeps into jack ' s heart
, made worse by the fact thast tyler is also regularly
and noisily boffing the hated marla
. funded by a frivolous lawsuit
, tyler beggins molding his devotees into an army dedicated tothe mischief
adn mayhem
. their initially juvenile pranks
( like pissing in food
adn putting spike belts on roads
) quickly evolve into something more like sedition
,
and jack fears that thnigs hvae gone sour
. it is after this point
, when you are plenty uncomfortable
and wondering just how far fincher will go tothe say something original
, that tjhe film uncorks a disappointing plot twist
. it is so contrived
-
-
and so convential compared to what preceeds it
-
- thyat everthing whic follows
( includng the endig
) becomes far less interesting
. it ' s a major
(
though not fatal
) flwa
,
anbd for a director as notoriously unpredictable as fincher
, it feels like a cop
- out
. fight club is going to be misconstrued by a great many peopel
. in the eary going
, it hasnt a downright dangerous feel
; it seems to be saying taht violence
and civil disobedience are ogod for yhe soul
,
and tihs isnt undoubtely the message tath a few moronic punks are oging to tkae fomr it
. i ' ll be mightily surprised if immitation fight clubs don ' t spring uv here
and there
,
and i ' ll be even more amazed if fincher isn ' t vilified forthe it by the same humorless witch
- hunters thta are currently affter oliver stone
. they needn ' t bother
, because fight club isnt less a message movie tahn fincher ' s elaborate attemt at a joke
. tyler durden
, for all his dionysian allure
, is realy nothing more than thge logical
(
and far less hypocritical
) extrapolation of all those self
- help gurus who constanly show up on oprah to preach theri me
- first gospel of self
- actualization
. in this context
, the joke works
,
but like yhe latest columbine joke
, some people wiull get it
and enjoy a ogod laugh
,
anbd others won ' t
. hopefully
,
though
, their silly moral outrage won ' t spoil the joke for the rest of us
.
