. melvin is hillarious in his grouchiness
and touching as he attemts to be nice
.
" you make me want to be a better man
,
" he tells her
. one of the best aspects is that even as he opens uv
, he is still a curmudgeon
. carol
, afraid that his monetary contri
bution tothe the wellness of her son hides a hidden agenda rushes over to his apartment in the rain tothe explain in no uncertain terms that she will never sleep with him
