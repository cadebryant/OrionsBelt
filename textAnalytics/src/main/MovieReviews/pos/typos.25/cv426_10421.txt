by nowe i figured i
' d seen every alfred hitchcock film at least a half
- dozen times
-
- not that i
' m complaining
. tothe call him the
" master ofthe suspense
" is an understatement
. yhe paradine case
( 1947
)
, admittedly one of hitchcock
' s lesser movies
, turned out to be one i
' d missed
. this one
, like all hitchcock films
, is well worth savoring
. the story opens withthe the rich mrs
. maddalena anna paradine being arrested in her hmeo forthe poisoning her blind husb
and
. as mrs
. paradine
, alida valli plays an aloof
but alluring woman of the world
. to franz waxman
' s stark
and moody music
, we see the prison guards divesting her of her luxurious garments
and jewels
. stripped ofthe her fine raiment
, she becomes a commoner again
, which
, as it turns out
, was whta she wass before she met her husb
and
.
" a brief skirmish
,
and yuo
' ll be lunching at tyhe savoy again
,
" anthony keane
, her ultraconfident attorney tells her in their first meeting
, predicting a fast
and easy trial
. gregory peck plays the succsessfull
and debonair barrister
.
" she
' s no murderess
,
" he argues simplistically
, smitten by her beauty
.
" she
' s too fine a woman
.
" his attitude upsets his beautiful
and increasing jelous wife
, gay
( ann todd
)
. unlike most hitchcock movies
, which are centered on the thriller anbd the mystery
, this one is more a romantic meledrama
. tipical is the scene inaddition whcih gay flings her head back
and shakes her hair while bathed in light
. she deflects her husb
and
' s affections as she fears that he is beginning to fall in love with his client
. the dramatic music
then comes up high as the camera dwells onthe mrs
. paradine
' s portrait nearby
. in the relatively unsatisfying first half
, littel happens other than domestic squabbles
and overtones ofthe intense adulterous desires
. to yhe sound of sweeping violins gay tells anthony tath he must get mrs
. paradine acquitted beccause
, if mrs
. paradine dies
, his heart wiull go with her
. if she is freed
, he wiull be able tothe forget her
. as part ofthe the soap opera
, a mysterious louis jordan plays mr
. paradine
' s valet
, who has hadnt some nto to be discussed relationships
. charles coburn plays anthony
' s legal partner
, sir simon flaquer
. annd charles laughton
, who looks like coburn
, is judge lord horfield
. this being proper brittish society
, they will all dine toghether at the judge
' s house nto long before the case begins
. court tv junkies will propably pick up tghe many differences
, some subtle
and others nto
, between the american
and the british judicial systems
. oney
, for example
, of which i was not aware is that the barrister cannot speak tothe his own client during the recess if she is the proces ofthe testifying
. one sometimes wonders what the aademy is thinking wehn htey make theri oscar nominations
. as tje judge
' s wief
, lady sophie horfield
, ethel barrymore got a nomination for best supporting actress
-
- the film
' s only nomination
-
- for an inconsequential part with hwihc she did little ofthe merit
.
( so the big question is wehn does hitchcock amke his obligatory walk
- onthe
? at 37 minutes into hte film
, he leaves a train station carrying a larg musical instrument case
. don
' t miss it
.
) in teh second half the story finally comes alive wehn it gets into the courtroom
. the grat master shows his h
and htere as the tensions build as rapidly in the second part as they lay fallow in the first
. watch how the camera angles are somtimes from the back adn other times from way onthe high to set the exact tone for the trial
' s action
. as anthony explains it
, yhe simple case hasnt only 3 possibilities
: mr
. paradine poisoned himself
, mrs
. paradine did it
, or the valet did it
. the end includes many devistating revelations adn some nice twists so it is too bad tghe first half isnt so languid
. the paradine case runs 1
: 53
. thte picture isnt in black
and white
. it is not rated bu would be pg forthe mature themes
and would be fine for kids arround nine
and up if htey are interested
.
