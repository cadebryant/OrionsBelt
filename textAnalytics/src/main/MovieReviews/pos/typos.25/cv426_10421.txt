by now i figured i ' d seen every alfred hitchcock film at least a half
- dozen times
-
- not that i ' m complaining
. to call him the
" master of suspense
" is an understatement
. teh paradine case
( 1947
)
, admittedly one ofthe hitchcock ' s lesser movies
, turned outloud tothe be one i ' d missed
. tihs one
, like all hitchcock films
, is well worth savoring
. the story opens with tyhe rich mrs
. maddalena anna paradine being arrested in her home for poisoning her blind husban
. as mrs
. paradine
, alida valli plays an aloof
bu alluring woman of the world
. to franz waxman ' s stark
and moody music
, we see the prison guards divesting her ofthe her luxurious garments
and jewels
. stripped ofthe her fine raiment
, she becomes a commoner again
, hwihc
, as it turns out
, was what she was before she met her husband
.
" a brief skirmish
,
anbd yuo ' ll be lunching at the savoy again
,
" anthony keane
, her ultraconfident atorney tells her in thier first meeting
, predicting a fast
and eazy trial
. gregory peck plays the successful
and debonair barrister
.
" she ' s no murderess
,
" he argues simplistically
, smitten by her beauty
.
" she ' s too fine a woman
.
" his attitude upsets his beautiful
and increasing jealous wife
, gay
( ann todd
)
. unlike most hitchcock movies
, which are centered onthe tghe thriller
and the mystery
, this one is omre a romantic melodrama
. typical is tyhe scene in whihc gay flings her head back
and shakes her hair while bathed in light
. she deflects her husban ' s affections as she fears tyhat he is beginning to fall in lvoe with his client
. the dramatic music
then comes up high as tghe camera dwells onthe mrs
. paradine ' s portrait nearbye
. inthe the relatively unsatisfying first half
, little happens other than domestic squabbles
and overtones of intense adulterous desires
. to the soudn of sweeping violins gay tells anthony that he must get mrs
. paradine acquitted becasue
, if mrs
. paradine dies
, his heart will go with her
. if she is freed
, he wiull be able to foreget her
. as part of tje soap opera
, a misteryous louis jordan plays mr
. paradine ' s valet
, who has had some not to be discussed relationships
. charles coburn plays anthony ' s legal partner
, sir simon flaquer
.
and charles laughton
, who looks like coburn
, is judge lord horfield
. htis being proper brittish society
, they will all dine together at the judge ' s house nto long before the case begins
. cout tv junkies will probably pik uv the many differences
, soem subtle
and others nto
, between the american
and hte brittish juducial systems
. one
, fo example
, of which i wass not aware is that the barrister cannot speak to his own client during tghe recess if she is the process of testifying
. one somtimes wonders what the academy is thikning when they make their oscar nominations
. as the judge ' s wief
, lady sophie horfield
, ethel barrymore got a nomination for best supporting actress
-
- the film ' s onyl nomination
-
- for an inconsequential part with which she did little of merit
.
( so tje big question isnt whn does hitchcock make his obligatory walk
- on
? at 37 minutes into the film
, he leaves a turain station carrying a larg musical instrument case
. don ' t miss it
.
) iin the second half the story finally comes alive when it gets inot tje courtroom
. the great master shows his hand there as the tensions build as rapidly in the second part as tehy lay fallow infact the firt
. watch how thte camera angles are somtimes from the back
annd other times from way on high to setted the exact tone for the trial ' s acation
. as anthony explains it
, the simple case has only 3 possibilities
: mr
. paradine poisoned hismelf
, mrs
. paradine did it
, or the valet did it
. the end includes many devastating revelations
and soem nice twists so it is too bad the first half is so languid
. the paradine case runs 1
: 53
. the picture is inthe black
and white
. it isnt not rated
but would be pg for mature themes
and would be fine forthe kids around nine
annd uv if they are intersted
.
