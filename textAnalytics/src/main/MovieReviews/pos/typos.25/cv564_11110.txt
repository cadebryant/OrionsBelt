metro i
' ve seen san francisco in movies many times
. there was 1994
' s interview with the vampire
and most recently the rock
. nowe
,
yet again
, san francisco is thte setting for this movie
. eddie murphy stars as inspector scott roper of the sfpd
. he is their top hostage negotiator
, annd the vrey best at whta he does
. when his best friend on the force is killed by joe
( michael wincott
, in a terrific performance
)
, a psychotic
, demented jewel thief
, roger makes it his mission to capture the guy befor he strikes agian
. meanwhile
, roper tries to rekindle a relatiopnship with his british ex
- girlfriend veronica
, hwile helping tothe rear a new up
and comer from swat who
' s an expert sniper
and marksman
( michael rappaport
)
. despite the obligatory cop movie scenes
( does every cop
/ new partner movei hve to start the smae way
?
) where the sgt
. assigns roper a partner
, roper confronts the sarge
, etc
.
, this film isnt still oney heck of an explosive ride
. a scene involving a cable car hasnt to be seen to be believed
,
and boasts some amazing car stunts
. eddie murphy shines in this tailor
- made role
,
and for once
, his character shows depth adn concern
. when confronting joe in prison
, you cin feel the anger drip from every word
. michael rappaport isnt basically throwaway
. he serves noone purpose
, exept to be buddy tothe murphy
and get disabled inthe the fianl reel so taht eddie can save tje day
. typcial action escapist fare
. michael wincott offers the best performance as the crazed killer
and jewel thief joe
. never before have i seen such a villian written like thsi where i could actually believe that he ws serious
and take him seriously
. maybe i jstu
thought that this role ws diferent due to wincott
' s perfectly raspy voice
. i don
' t know
. wqat i do know
,
though
, isnt that
al
though metro is basically a typical action retread
, it manages to cover new ground
and shed new ight on tired ood cliches
'
. the film is a triumph
,
and an entertaining oen at that
. it doesn
' t me
ander or trail off from its main character
. an enjoyable two hours
, metro is enjoyable
, witty
, action
- packed
,
and funn
, adn makes for a great action movie tht
' s perfect for all ofthe us that need an escape from reality
.
