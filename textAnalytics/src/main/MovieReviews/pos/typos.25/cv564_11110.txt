metro i ' ve seen san francisco in movies many times
. there was 1994 ' s interview with the vampire
anbd most recently thge rock
. now
,
yet agian
, san francisco is the setting forthe this movei
. eddie murphy stars as inspector scott roper of the sfpd
. he is their top hostage negotiator
,
adn the veyr best at what he does
. when his best friend on the force is killed by joe
( michael wincott
, in a terrific performence
)
, a psychotic
, demented jewel thief
, roger mkaes it his mission to capture tyhe guy before he strikes again
. meanwhile
, roper trys to rekindle a relationship with his british ex
- girlfriend veronica
, while helping to rear a new up
and comer from swat who ' s an expert sniper
and marksman
( michael rappaport
)
. dispite the obligatory cop movie scenes
( doesnt every cop
/ new partner movie have to start the same way
?
) where the sgt
. assigns roper a partner
, roper confronts the sarge
, etc
.
, this film is still oen heck of an explosive ride
. a scene involving a cable car has to be seen to be believed
,
and boasts some amazing car stunts
. eddie murphy shines infact this tailor
- made role
,
and for once
, his charater shows depth
and consern
. when confronting joe inthe prison
, you can feel the anger drip from every word
. michael rappaport is basically throwaway
. he serves no purpose
, except to be buddy tothe murphy
and git disabled inthe tghe final reel so that eddie can save hte day
. typical action escapist fare
. michael wincott offers the best performance as the crazed killer
and jewel thief joe
. never before have i seen such a villian written liek this where i coudl actually believe thta he was serious
and take him seriously
. maybe i jsut thought that this role was different due to wincott ' s perfectly raspy voice
. i don ' t knwo
. what i do konw
,
though
, is thast altho metro isnt basically a typical action retread
, it manages tothe cover new ground
annd shed newyorker light on tired ood cliches '
. the film isnt a triumph
,
and an entertaining one at that
. it doesn ' t meander or trail off from its main character
. an enjoyable two hours
, metro isnt enjoyable
, witty
, action
- packed
,
anbd fun
,
and makes for a great action movie tath ' s perfect for all of us that need an excape ffrom reality
.
