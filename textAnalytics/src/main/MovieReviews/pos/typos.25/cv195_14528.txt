there exists a litany of differences between a successful action movei
and a successful suspense movie
. action movies are typically devoid of plot otehr than a simple byline whlch can string together several explosive sequences
, while suspense movies hinge onthe plot annd subtlety anbd the ablity to bring everything full
- circle
. for fans of both genres
, howver
, realism is key
. acation fans want to nkow tht the weapons
and methods their herose are useing are au
thentic
,
and suspense fans want everyting to fall into an explainable framework by the movie
' s end
. on this advice
, directer john frankenheimer
( the isl
and of dr
. moreau
) strives forthe realism in an interestingly dynamic balance of suspense
and action for his latest thriller
, ronin
. the depth of intrigue inspite ronin is quite amazing
, considering the fare that
' s fallen into the same category over the last few years
. yhe scirpt
, written by j
. d
. zeik in his big
- screen de
but
, approaches levels of complexity tath had peopel spinning away from mission
: impossible two years ago
. a ceratin number of people will be lost by tihs
,
but afficianados will appreciate it all the more adn return multiple times
. frankenheimer masters the script iwth poise
,
and tells us a dark
but stoically realistic tale of a group of post
- cold war mercenaries working to earn their paycheck
. his abillity to convey feeling
and charactor while promoting explosiveness
and tense atmosphere works well here
, anbd ronin becomes a better movie because ofthe it
. robert de niro headlines this cast of noteworthies in a performance tyhat is the most outst
anding ofthe his inwhich quite some time
. he takes comm
and
and offers much gravity as the ex
- spy sam
, a man who
' s called to france to halp a shady operations controller named dierdre
( natascha mcelhone
) recover a package
. the package becomes the central motivator for the entire cast
, especially once the requisite double
- crossing begins
,
and its role is skillfully penned by zeik
. at times
,
however
, zeik
' s tale becomes almost too reminiscent of mission
: impossible
- de niro might easily become tom cruise
, the package might become cruise
' s computer disk
. fortunately
, the focus here is almost entirely on thge package
, whereas iin mission the script was more concerned with the double
- cross
and why it happened
. the action content is impressive
,
and it lives up to the hints given in previews
. the only fans who will be disappointed are those who expect full
- blown combat scenes adn instade are forced to suffer through moments of slowness
. ronin doesnt tkae a degree of intelligence to folow all of the nuance ffrom strat to finish
, bu even thte uninitiated wiull be able to keep a grasp on most characters m
and subplots
. the suspense tapers off considerably by tjhe end
, a bited of a drawback becasue of its height at the movie
' s ope
. concidering theese factors it
' s good to see that ronin was a project that turned out well
, anbd it
' s another good bet thsi month
. usance quality is usally sparse during the early fall months
, it
' s definitely worth the visit
.
