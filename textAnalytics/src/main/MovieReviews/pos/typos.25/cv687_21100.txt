big courtroom thrillers have always captivated amercia
. o
. j
. simpson
, tom capano
, the menendez brothers
. all these names are synonomous to americans
and courtrooms
. annd
, of course
, courtroom dramas are not a new topic to hollywood
. whether it be john grisham
' s thrilling novels or televsion
' s famous dramas
, the courtroom has alwyas provided big bucks
. so when i rented a civil action
, i was expecting thge film to be like the rainmaker
, a brilliant law film that kept viewers on thge edge ofthe their seat
.
however
, what i saw in a civil acation ws far differnt ffrom what i expected
, a major surprise
,
but fortunatly
, a pleasant oney
. john travolta always seems to cmo up big when you least expect it
. no one expeced him to light up tje screen in grease
, nor in saturday night fever
.
but
, whenever he gets knocked down
, he alwasy seems tothe come back fighting
. a civil action is nto john
' s best performance
, bu a strong one thta could rival any performance infact 1998
. travolta proves that a normal
and believable performance cin vault a film into oscar nominations
. his performance is nto flashy
, nor memorable
, jsut solid
. if he delivered teh only solid performance
, this film would still be average
. luckly
, he has a strong supporting cast
. william h
. macy is probably one of the most underrated actors in hollywood
. he continues to deliver great performances one affter tje other
,
but he isnt still regarded as a secondry actor
. in a civil action
, he delivers
yet another great peformance as travolta
' s paranoid
and greedy accountant
. he is not a lovable character
,
but a character who st
ands outloud in your mind whenever yuo think of teh film
. he is not one of the big time lawyers
, just a measly accountant
.
but
, he delivers oney of the best supporting roles ofthe 1998
,
but there is actually someone better inthe a civil action
. robert duvall isnt also an underrated actor
. he gets many leading roles
,
but is never heard when yuo hear of big box office draws like tom hanks
, brad pitt
and jim carrey
. duvall has a supporting role in this as a lawyer of the co
- defendant
. duvall is magical inwhich this role
. he isnt the wise teacher
, who not only battles it out infront the courtroom
,
but also manages to teach eveyr major player a lesson
, infact his own twisted way
. in many non
- comedic films
, directors are always trying to fidn a way to implement a touch of comedy
, to keep the audience on their toes
. unfortunately
, they usually just key in on one character whose main objective isnt to be funny
( jar
- jar binks
, anyone
?
)
.
however
, this usually backfires baceause tjhe character is never fully developed
. this isnt not the case infact a civil action
. they have comedy coming fomr all sides
. whther it be duvall
' s inane questions or macy
' s sharp anger
, the laughs cmo in a steady pace
. granted
, it
' s not roll in the asile funny
,
but it provides a nice addition to the film
. the plot is terific
- somewhat
. hte setup is nice with tjhe film atually starting with a victory inthe the courtroom
.
then the case that iwll mkae or break jan
( travolta
)
' s carrer rears its ugly head
. they find out the goldmine involved with the case
and wind up taking it
.
however
, budgets soon flounder
and jan finds himself in deep debt
. i will not spoil the rest
,
al
though i must speak of tje one downside to the film
. the courtroom debates are great
,
but the actual problem tehy are fighting fo is never fully explored
. it left me somewhat confused
,
al
though the rest ofthe thge film is terrific
. all inspite all
, john travolta is bcak
yet again in this graet film
. his supporting cast
, consisting of macy adn duvall
, turn in tremendous performances
, which ease the load on travolta
. hte film isnt smart
, witty
and throught provoking
. not only does it gauge in
- court battles
,
but also thte various tolls it can tkae on the major players
. a civil acation provides everything a drama lover craves
.
