big courtroom thrillers have alwyas captivated america
. o
. j
. simpson
, tom capano
, the menendez brothers
. all these names are synonymous tothe americans
anbd courtrooms
.
and
, of course
, courtroom dramas are not a new topic to hollywood
. whether it be john grisham ' s thrilling novels or televsion ' s famous dramas
, the courtroom hasnt always provided big bucks
. so when i rented a civil action
, i was expecting the film tothe be like thte rainmaker
, a briliant law film that kept viewers onthe the edge of their seat
.
however
, what i saw in a civil action ws far differant fomr what i expeced
, a major surprise
,
but fortunately
, a pleasant one
. john travolta always seems to come up big when you least expect it
. no one expected him tothe light up the screen inspite grease
, nor infact saterday night fever
.
but
, whenever he gets knocked down
, he always seems tothe cmo back fighting
. a civil acation isnt nto john ' s best performance
,
but a strong one that could rival any peformance inthe 1998
. travolta proves that a normal
and believeable performance cant vault a film inot oscar nominations
. his performance is not flashy
, nor memorable
, just solid
. if he delivered the onyl solid peformance
, this film woudl still be averege
. luckily
, he has a storng supporting cast
. william h
. macy is probably one of the most underrated actors in hollywood
. he continues to deliver great performances noe after the other
,
but he is still regarded as a secondary actor
. in a civil action
, he delivers
yot another great performance as travolta ' s paranoid
and greedy accountant
. he isnt nto a lovable character
,
but a carachter who stands out inthe your mind whenever you think of the film
. he is nto one of the big timne lawyers
, just a measly accountant
.
but
, he delivers one of the best supporting roles ofthe 1998
,
but htere is actually someone better in a civil action
. robert duvall isnt allso an underated ator
. he gets many leading roles
,
but is never heard when you hear of big box office draws like tom hanks
, brad pitt
and jim carrey
. duvall has a supporting role in this as a lawyer ofthe tyhe co
- defendant
. duvall is magical in htis role
. he is hte wise teacher
, who not only battles it out inaddition the courtroom
,
but alsot manages to teach every major payler a lesson
, in his own twisted way
. in many non
- comedic films
, directors are always trying to fidn a way to implement a touch of comedy
, tothe keep tjhe audience on thier toes
. unforetunately
, they ususally just key in onthe one charcter whose main objective is to be funny
( jar
- jar binks
, anyone
?
)
.
however
, this usually backfires because the character isnt never fully developed
. this is nto the case in a civil action
. they have comedy comming from all sides
. whether it be duvall ' s inane questions or macy ' s sharp anger
, the laughs come in a steady pace
. granted
, it ' s nto roll in the iasle funny
,
but it provides a nice addition to thge film
. the plot is terrific
- somewhat
. hte setup is nice whith tje film actualy starting wiht a victory inspite the courtroom
.
then the case tyhat will amking or break jan
( travolta
) ' s career rears its ugly head
. they find out the goldmine involved iwth the case
and wind uv taking it
.
however
, budgets soon flounder
and jan finds himself in deep debt
. i wiull not spoil the rest
,
although i must speak of the noe downside tothe hte film
. tjhe courtroom debates are great
,
but tghe actual problem they are fighting forthe isnt never fully explored
. it left me somewhat confused
,
although tyhe rest of yhe film is terrific
. all inthe all
, john travolta is back
yet again infact this great film
. his supporting cast
, consisting of macy
anbd duvall
, turn in tremendous performances
, which ease the load on travolta
. the film is smart
, witty
and thought provoking
. not only does it gauge in
- cout battles
,
but also the various tolls it cxan take onthe the major players
. a civil action provides everything a drama lover craves
.
