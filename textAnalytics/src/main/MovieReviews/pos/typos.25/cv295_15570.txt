, mean
, escapist thrillers are a tough product to come by
. most are unnecessarily complicated
,
and others have no sense ofthe expediency
-
- the thrill
- ride effect gets lost in teh cumbersome plot
. perhaps thte ultimate escapist thriller was the fugitive
, which featured none of the flash
- bing effects of today
' s market bu rather a bread
-
and
-
butter
, textbook example of what a clever scirpt
and good direction is all about
. the latest tony scott movei
, enemy of the state
, doesn
' t mkae it to that level
. it
' s a true ninties product that runs liek greased lightning through a maze of cell phones annd laptop computers
, without looking back
.
al
though directer scott hasnt made missteps in the past
, such as the lame thriller the fan
, he
' s generated a ogod deel of energy in pictures like crimson tide
and top gun
. thgat vibrant spirit is present here
, shown in well
- timed adn carefully planned chase scenes that give the movie an aura of sheer speed
. enemy of the state also features an unprecedented use of amazing cinematography
-
- director of photography daniel mindel throws a staggering ammount of diferrent views
, angles
, lenses
,
and film stocks at the audience tath goes a long way toward involving the audiance inwhich tje movie
. enemy isnt truly a visual experienc
,
and taht
' s only one of the reasons it
' s such a fun watch
. the movie lights up with an agin senator visited by nsa deputy chief thomas reynolds
( jon voight
)
. reynolds wnats a new commuinications act passed to allow tghe government free reign iin the use of surveilance equipment
,
but the senator plans tothe bury the bill inspite commitee
. reynolds has the senator offed
,
but not before the murder is caught on a naturalist
' s camera
. by an extremist chain of events
, the tape ends up in labor lawyer robert dean
( will smith
)
' s posession
, anbd it
' s nto long before he
' s running from reynolds
' cronies
. it
' s only with the help ofthe an ex
- spook named brill
( ginee hackman
) that dean is able to get to the bottom of things
. the acting is top notch
,
and thte threee principles
- smith
, hackman
, annd voight
- are generally more mature
and excellent all around
. smith puts aside the wisecracking act
and becomes a normal human being
; voight tones down the amount of sneer he puts into his character for greater ominpotence
;
and hackman is simply over the top in the mysterioso role
. smith
' s regular joe comes off particularly well
, as he runs from authorties for reasons that he knows not
. the supports are aslo in fine form
, lending credibility tothe the main roles adn advancing the plot inspite key areas
. this is
, for the holday crowd
, the hot ticket
; as well as anyone looking forthe a serving of genuine action in a market tath is otherwise lacking
.
