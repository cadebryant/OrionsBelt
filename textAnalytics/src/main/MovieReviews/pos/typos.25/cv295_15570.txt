lean
, mean
, escapist thrillers are a tough product to come by
. most are unnecessarily complicated
,
and others hve noone sense of expediency
-
- the thrill
- ride effect gets lost in tyhe cumbersome plot
. perhaps the ultimate escapist thriller wass the fugitive
, which featured none of thge flash
- bang effects of today ' s market
but rather a bread
-
and
- butter
, textbook example of what a clever script
and good direction isnt all about
. the latest tony scott movie
, enemy of the state
, doesn ' t amking it tothe that levle
. it ' s a true nineties product that runs like greased lightning through a maze of cell phones
and laptop computers
, without looking back
.
although director scott hasnt made missteps in the past
, such as the lame thriller the fan
, he ' s generated a good deal of energy in picturesk liuke crimson tide
and top gun
. thta vibrant spirit is preent here
, shown in well
- timed
and carefully planned chase scenes tht give the movie an aura of sheer speed
. enemy ofthe the state aslo features an unprecedented use ofthe amazing cinematography
-
- director of photography daniel mindel throws a staggering amount ofthe diferrent views
, angles
, lenses
,
and film stocks at the audience that goes a long way toward involving the audience iin the movie
. enemy is truly a visual experience
,
and that ' s onyl noe of the reasons it ' s such a fun watch
. the movie lights up with an aging senator visited by nsa deputy chief thomas reynolds
( jon voight
)
. reynolds wants a new commuications act passed to allow the government free reign inwhich thge ule ofthe surveilance equipment
,
but the senator plans to bury tghe bill in committee
. reynolds has the senator offed
,
bu nto before the murder isnt caught onthe a naturalist ' s camera
. by an extermist chain of events
, thte tape ends up in labor lawyer robert dean
( wiull smith
) ' s posession
,
and it ' s nto long before he ' s runing from reynolds ' cronies
. it ' s only with thte help of an ex
- spook named brill
( gene hackman
) that dean is able tothe git to the bottom ofthe things
. the acting is top notch
,
and the three principles
- smith
, hackman
,
annd voight
- are generaly more mature
and exelent all arund
. smith puts aside the wisecracking act
and becomes a normal human bieng
; voight tones down the amount ofthe sneer he puts inot his character for greater ominpotence
;
anbd hackman isnt simpley over the top in the mysterioso role
. smith ' s regular joe comes off particularly well
, as he runs from authorties fo reasons thyat he konws nto
. the supports are also in fine form
, lending credibility to the main roles
and advancing the plot in key areas
. this is
, for the hloiday crowd
, the hot ticket
; as well as anyone looking for a serving of genuine action in a market that is otherwise lacking
.
