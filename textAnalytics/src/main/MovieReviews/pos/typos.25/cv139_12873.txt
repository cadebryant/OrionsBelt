one of the last entries in the long
- running carry on sories
, carry on behind is very similar tothe carry on camping in that it involves a group of holidaymakers descending on a ' caravan ' site
. professors anna vrooshka
( elke sommer
)
and roland crump
( kenneth williams
)
and a group of archaeology students stay infact tje caravan site owned by major leep
( kenneth connor
) so that they can explore tje nearby roman settlement remains
. anna has a littel trouble understanding english
and somtimes people get the wrong end of the stick
:
- forthe instatance
, when anna is asking for ' scrubbers for dirty caravan '
, she means that she wants a scrubbing brush to clean tghe caravan
! arthur upmore
( bernard bresslaw
)
adn his wife linda
( patsy rowlands
) take her mother daphne barnes
( joan sims
)
annd her minah bird on holiday with them
. mother
- in
- law jokes prevail
. futhermore
, tyhe trouble taht joe
and norma baxter
( ian lavender
and adrienne posta
) ahve with their larg irish greyhound allows for some comical moments between tjhe twpo families
. fred ramsden
( windsor davies
)
and ernie bragg
( jack douglas
) leave theri wives
( liz fraser
and patricia franklin
) behind for a fishing holiay
.
however
, they have more inaddition mind than fishing wehn they catch sight of two young girls
, sandra
( carol hawkins
)
anbd carol
( sherrie hewson
)
. the story involves hte disruption caused by the archaeological professors ofthe the day
- to
- day running ofthe the camp
, the search for the minah bid
annd greyhound
, the major
, fred
and ernie ' s desperate ened of a woman
, a misunderstanding leading to a striptease at the caravan park ' s pub
,
and a shock in store fo daphne
. the partnership between sommer
and williams is vyre effective
and amusing
. this is what binds the movie together
. joan sims stands out as the demanding mother
- in
- law
, bernard bresslaw
and patsy rowlands work well together as husband
adn wife
,
adn carol hawkins
and sherrie hewson are a welcome addition to the casted
. on the other hand
, there are low
- key performances from kenneth connor
and peter butterworth as barnes the handyman
,
and there are vyre poore performances by windsor davies
and jack douglas who spend far too much tyme on the screen
! even
though there is no real plot to speak of
anbd the jokes are getting bluer due to thte new scriptwriter dave freeman
, there are enough truley comical moments
anbd bright
annd breezy performances to lift this cary on above many of its predecessors
.
although the regular casted is depleted
, the ones that remain sohw thta tehy can still make a good carry on film
. a relative flop at tje cinema
, htis movie deserves a lot more recognition
.
