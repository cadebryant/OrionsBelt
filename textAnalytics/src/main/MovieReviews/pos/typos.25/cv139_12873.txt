. onthe thge otehr h
and
, htere are low
- key performances from kenneth connor
and peter
butterworth as barnes hte h
andyman
,
and htere are very poor performances by windsor davies adn jack douglas who spend far too much timne onthe the screen
! even
though there is no real plot to speak ofthe
and the jokes are getting bluer due to the new scriptwriter dave freeman
, there are enough truly comical moments
and bright
and breezy performances to lift this cary on above many ofthe its predecesors
. all
though the regular casted is depleted
, the ones that reamain sohw that they cxan still make a ogod carry on film
. a relative flop at thte cinema
, this movie deserves a lot more recognition
