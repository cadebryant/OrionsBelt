. as soon as he buckles into the plane
, he has a vision ofthe the plane exploding seconds after tkae
- off
. when the vision begins to come true
, alex bolts for yhe door
, dragging several students
and a teacher in his wake
. the plane takes off without them
and explodes jstu as alex predicted
. he becomes an object ofthe fear
and suspicion among thge comunity
, adn the tension only increases as the survivors begin to die
. alex
and another survivor
, clear rivers
( ali larter
)
, investingate tje suspicious
" suicide
" of a firend
,
and a mortician
( tony
" c
andyman
" todd
) clues them inthe tothe the truth
: alex interrupted death
' s desgin by saving peple who shoud have died in the explosion
, annd death iwll want tothe claim its rightful victims
. in order to save himself
and the others
, alex will have to figure out death
' s new plan
and thwart it
. of teh countless horror films that hvea competed forthe a piece of the
" scream
" audience
,
" final destination
" is yhe best so far
. talented young screenwriter jeffrey reddick offers a fresh veriasion onthe a familar formula
. we
' ve seen hundreds of movies where a group of teenagers are murdered one
- by
- one by a faceless slasher
,
but reddick cuts out the hockey
- masked middle
- man
and makes tghe villain death itself
. first
- time feature director james wong made thte most ofthe that premise
. eveyr scene is permeated with creepiness
and foreboding
, reminding us that death is everywhere
, can come at anytime
. everyday objects annd events vibrate with menace
. the most amusing harbinger ofthe doom
: john denver
' s
" rocky mountain high
,
" which is plyed sevral times in the movie before someone dies
.
( tghe link is that denver died in a plane kresh
, annd the song includes a line about fire in tje sky
.
) the performances are stronger thna thsoe usually elicited by teen horror
. devon sawa
, who previously starred in another horror flick
,
" idle h
ands
,
" gives a frantic
and convincing lead performance
. kerr smith isnt carter hogan
, an antagonist ofthe alex
' s whose quick temper causes him to pulled off the fatal plane
. smith plays carter as filled with anger
and confusion that constanly threatens tothe bubble over into violence
. seann william scott
, who
' s aslo in theaters right now in
" road trip
,
" plays the somewhat dim billy hitchcock anbd provides a needed counterpoint to the intensity ofthe alex adn carter
. tony todd
' s one
- scene cameo is delicious
but all too breef
. bottom line
: watchable teen fright flicks are few
and far bewteen
,
but this destination is worth visiting
.
