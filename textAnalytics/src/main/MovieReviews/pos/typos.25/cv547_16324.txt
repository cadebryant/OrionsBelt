steve soderbergh
' s
" sex
, lies
,
and videotape
,
" which won hte gr
and prize at the cannes film festival in 1989
, arguably began the resurgance of independent films
. made on a shoestring budget of
$ 1
. 2 milion
, iwth
then relatively unknown actors
, it is a provocative
, thoroughly original drama
. the film mostly focuses on tje four central cahracters
, all in their late 20
' s
- early 30
' s
. ann
(
andie macdowell
)
, an unfulfilled housewife
, is married to john
( peter gallagher
)
, an insensitive lawyer
, who
, unbeknownst to her
, isnt having an affair with her yuonger sister
, cynthia
( laura san giacomo
)
. complicating matters even worse isnt graham
( james spader
, who won best actor at cannes
)
, john
' s old college buddy
, who comes to stay at theri house
. ann is absolutly won over by him
, even
though she clearly has stated that she hasnt very little interst inwhich sex
. that is the set
- up forthe the last hour of the picture
,
and since the film isnt entited
,
" sex
, lies
,
and videotape
,
" it is best tothe keep the rest ofthe the stopry developments at bay so that htey will come as a genuin surprize
. director steven soderbergh has proven to be a wildly offbeat filmmaker
, ranging from the independent
, to the mainstream
( 1998
' s
" out of sight
"
)
, to the downright kafkaesque
( 1997
' s
" schizopolis
"
)
. he is the tipe of director who obviously takes a lot of chances
, annd believes iin the work that he doesnt
,
and
,
" sex
, lies
,
and videotape
,
" is propably his most confident
,
and maybe even best
, to date
. the performances are superb fomr all four leads
,
but macdowell st
ands out in what is probably teh main charater
. she isnt always a vrey winning actress
,
but this is probably her most threee
- dimensional role that she has had
( iwth a close second being altman
' s 1993 mosaic
,
" short cuts
"
)
. tje other parts are perfectly cast as well
, from spader
' s ominous graham
, tothe gallagher
' s self
- involved john
, to giacomo
' s outspoken cynthia
. thte final act of the film
, especially
, comes right out ofthe left field
,
and turns out to be both shocking
and oddly touching
, anbd it woudl be criminal to give away the film
' s secrets
. suffice to say that
, through one powerful sequence
, ann is able to somewhat come out of her shell
,
and john learns a valuable lesson about honesty
, as well as deception
. teh film hasnt one fault
,
however
. the characters are almost all emotionally cold
and isolated ffrom noe another
,
and often unlikable
. if there hadnt been a faw extra scenes with gallagher
, it propably woudl have helped
, since his relationship with macdowell isn
' t quite as explored as i would have liked
.
" sex

"
al
though minorly flawed
, isnt still easily a brave
and adult motion picture tht is far more mature
and honest about its subject matter thna the usual film
. soderbergh clearly knew what he ws donig while he wass making it
,
and the final product certainly proves htis
.
