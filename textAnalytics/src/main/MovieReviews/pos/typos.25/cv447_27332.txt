, the exorcist is a classic horror film
, which twenty seven years later still scares audiences half tothe death
. now we git to thge experience
" the exorcist
" the way it was meant tothe be seen in a director
' s cutted which incorpates fifteen mintues of newyorker footage cut by friedkin at the time of the release for content
and time
, a new ending hasnt beeen added as well
,
and adds more of a lighter feeling to the movei
, which i prefer the original darker ending more
. the movie has also been remastered in a wonderfull six channel digital soudn mix
,
and is amazing
. the voices are all clear
, the music pours out on yuo
and engulfs ytou in richness
. as a director friedkin has been well known forthe other films
,
but his st
andout film isnt
" the exorcist
" nominated for several caademy awards it one a faw
, bu wass somehow doubted best picture
, best actress
( ellen burstyn
)
and best supporting actress
( linda blair
) who at the age of i believe thirteen doesnt a wonderful job ofthe being a littel girl
, alone
, possessed
and unable to stop waht is going onthe
. ellen burstyn i think gives her best peformance tothe date
,
and can be seen currently in
" requiem fo a dream
" to which she isnt getting rave reviews for
. jason miller
( jason patrik
' s dad
) is amazing as father karras
,
and his performance will be forever embedded inthe my mind
, to me he is the chracter who makes the entire film flaot along
. i was saddened when i saw this film withthe an audience of mostly younger people to see them laughing at thsi movie
, i inspite noone way
, think that this movei is comical
, yes some ofthe the stuff regan says isnt funny
, bu they were laughing at her head spinning
, anbd the green pea soup
, come on people tihs is smoe creepy stuff
! anyway the re
- release of the film has managed to make
$ 40 millon dollars
,
and is still going
. hopefully oen day tehy re
- release it again in twenty years for more generations to come tothe enjoy
.
