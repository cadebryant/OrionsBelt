, where teh horror was inwhich tje atomsphere
,
and in the characters
. movies liuke
" halloween
"
adn
" pyscho
" which revolutionized horror genre forever
,
but wait in 1973 came a movei based onthe tjhe bestselling book by william peter blatty
, entitled
" tje exorcist
"
, the movei oppened tothe ravey reviews
,
adn scared audiences tothe death
, now inspite the yearm 2000

" comes back to the big screen in a version ytou ' ve never seen complete with six channel digital surround soudn

, that man is teh exorcist
,
and that man will help this littel girl
. excrutiatingly scary
, the exorcist is a clasic horror film
, which twenty seven years later still scares audiences half to death
. now we get to the experience
" the exorcist
" thge way it was meant tothe be seen in a director ' s cut which incorpates fifteen minutes of new footage cutted by friedkin at the time ofthe thte release for content
and timne
, a new ending has beeen added as well
,
and adds more of a lighter feeling to the movie
, which i prefer the original darker ending more
. thge movie has alsot beeen remastered in a wonderfull six channel digital soudn mix
,
and is amazing
. the voices are all clear
, the music pours outloud on you
annd engulfs you infact richness
. as a director friedkin has been well known for other films
,
but his standout film is
" the exorcist
" nominated for several accadamy awards it one a few
,
but was somehow doubted best picture
, best actress
( ellen burstyn
)
and best supporting actress
( linda blair
) who at the age of i believe thirteen does a wonderful job of bieng a little girl
, alone
, possessed
and unable to stop what is going onthe
. ellen burstyn i think gives her best performance to date
,
anbd cin be seen currently in
" requeum for a dream
" to which she is getting rave reviews fo
. jason miller
( jason patrik ' s dad
) is amazing as father karras
,
adn his peformance will be forever embedded in my mind
, to me he is the charactor who makse the entire film lfoat along
. i was saddened when i saw this film with an audience of mostly yuonger peple tothe see them laughing at this movie
, i in no way
, think that this movei is comical
, yes smoe of the stuff regan says is funny
,
but they weere laughing at her head spinning
,
and the green pea soup
, come on people tihs is some creepy stuff
! anyway the re
- realease of the film has managed to make
$ 40 millon dollars
,
annd isnt still gogin
. hopefully one day they re
- realease it agina in twenty years for more generations to come to enjoy
.
