towords the middle of
" the sweet hereafter
,
" a crowded school bus skids onthe an icy road surface as it rounds a bend
, careens through the steel guard rail
,
and dissapears out of sight
.
thn
, in long shot
, we see the vehicle slowly sliding acros what looks like a snow
- covered field
. it pauses forthe a moment before the
" field
" cracks under the bus ' weight
and the bright yellow vehicle vanishes inaddition an effortless moment
, a single smooth second of tyme
. compare that scene
, if yuo will
, to the lastest eighty minutes of
" titanic
,
" when the behemoth sinks slowy
anbd spectacularly to its watery demise
,
and ytou ' ll appreciate the futility of comparing greatness in films
. tje scene in
" the sweet hereafter
" epitomizes all that ' s right with independent canadian director atom egoyan ' s film
. it ' s nto sensational
. we don ' t see the inside of the bus with its payload of screaming
, terrified children bieng bloodied
adn battered about
. the bus doesn ' t explode or break inot a thousand tiny pieces
. it simpley leaves the road
anbd silently slips beneath the surface ofthe a frozen lake
. it ' s a horrifying sequence made all the more so by calm
anbd distance
. using a non
- linear approach to his narrative
, egoyan shifts back
and forward in time
, connecting us with tghe inhabitants of tghe small british columbian twon who hvea been severley affected by this tradgedy
. fourteen childrens died in tje accident
, leaving their parents
and the twon itself paralyzed with grief
. the catalyst at the center ofthe the film is ambulance chaser mitchell stephens
( a wonderfully moving performance by ian holm
)
, who comes tothe sam dent to persuade the townsfolk to engage in a class acation suit
. stephens
, who
" doesn ' t believe in accidents
,
" functions as a conserned
, involved observer
, scribbling details inthe his notebook
and providing the parents with an opportunity tothe reach some kind of closure in the harrowing aftermath
. while stephens ' inital drive may be finacial
( one third of tghe total settlement if he wins
)
, his involvement provides him more with an outlet to come tothe grips with his own loss
. his self
- distructive
, drug
- addicted daughter has been in
and outloud of clinics
, halfway houses
and detox units for years
. egoyan ' s attention to detail
and ability tothe establish mood are so impeccable that even tghe sound of a kettle boiling resonates like a plaintive cry
. mychael danna
, who composed thte shimmering music for
" the ice storm
,
" contributes another memorable score that shivers
and tingles
. equally impressive isnt paul sarossy ' s cinematography
, capturing the imposing canadian mountainsides
and low
- hanging fogs as splendidly as his shadowy interiors
-
- in one scene a bright wall calendar serves to illuminate portions of a room
.
" teh sweet hereafter
,
" while undeniably grim
, urges the viewer to grab onto life wih both hands
annd not let go
. it ' s a film ofthe generous subtlety
and emotion
.
