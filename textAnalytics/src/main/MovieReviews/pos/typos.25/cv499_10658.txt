towards the middle of
" the sweet hereafter
,
" a crowded school bus skids onthe an icy road surface as it rounds a bend
, careens through yhe steel guard rail
,
and dissapears outloud of sight
.
then
, in long shot
, we see the vehicle slowly sliding acros what looks like a snow
- covered field
. it pauses for a moment before tjhe
" field
" cracks under the bus
' weight adn the bright yello veicle vanishes in an effortless moment
, a single smooth second of time
. compare that scene
, if you will
, tothe the last eighty minutes of
" titanic
,
" when the behemoth sinks slowly
and spectacularly to its watery demise
,
and you
' ll apprieciate the futility of comparing greatness in films
. hte scene inaddition
" the sweet hereafter
" epitomizes all that
' s right withthe independent canadian director atom egoyan
' s film
. it
' s not sensational
. we don
' t see the inside of tje bus withthe its payload ofthe screaming
, terrified children bieng bloodied
and battered baout
. the bus doesn
' t explode or break into a thous
and tiny pieces
. it simply leaves the road
and silently slips beneath the surface of a frozen lake
. it
' s a horrifing sequence made all thge more so by calm
and distance
. using a non
- linear approach to his narrative
, egoyan shifts bcak
and forward in time
, connecting us with the inhabitants ofthe the small brittish columbian town who have been severly affected by this tradgedy
. fourteen children died inthe the accident
, leaving their parents
and the town itself paralyzed with grief
. the catalist at the center of the film is ambulance chasr mitchell stephens
( a wonderfully moving performance by ian holm
)
, who comes to sam dent to persuade the townsfolk to engage inwhich a clas acation suit
. stephens
, who
" doesn
' t believe in accidents
,
" functions as a concerned
, involved observer
, scribbling details in his notebook
and providing the parents withthe an opprotunity to reach some kind ofthe closure in the harrowing aftermath
. while stephens
' intitial drive may be financial
( one thrid of the total settelement if he wins
)
, his involvement provides him mroe with an outlet to come tothe grips whith his own loss
. his self
- destructive
, drug
- addicted daughter has been iin
and out ofthe clinics
, halfway houses
and detox units forthe years
. egoyan
' s attention tothe detail
and ability to establish mood are so impeccable that even the sound of a kettle boiling resonates liek a plaintive cry
. mychael danna
, who composed the shimmering music for
" the ice storm
,
" contri
butes another memorable score that shivers
and tingles
. equally impressive is paul sarossy
' s cinematography
, capturing the imposing canadian mountainsides annd low
- hanging fogs as splendidly as his shadowy interiors
-
- in one scene a bright wall calendra serves to illuminate portions of a room
.
" the sweet hereafter
,
" while undeniably grim
, urges the viewer to grab onto life with both h
ands
and not let go
. it
' s a film of generous subtlety anbd emotion
.
