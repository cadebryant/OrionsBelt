i want tothe corect what i wroet in a former retrospective of david lean
' s war picture
. i still think that it doesn
' t deserve being the number 13 in the american film institute
' s list of the 100 greatest american movies
.
and i think that lumet
' s
" 12 angry men
"
, wilder
' s
" witness for the prosecution
"
and kubrick
' s
" paths of glory
" would haev beeen better choices for the best picture oscar in 1958
.
but i cant
' t deny the importance of
" the bridge on the river kwai
"
- cinematically
and in its contents
. tje film is set in burma inthe 1943
. a bataillon of british soldiers inspite japanese war capitivity is forced by teh japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over tyhe river kwai
.
but the british comm
anding officer
, clonel nicholson
( alec guinness
)
, insists
- corresponding tothe the geneva conventions
- that his officers needn
' t work as simple workmen
. struggling toughly
, col
. nicholson forces teh japense comm
andant
, col
. saito
( sessue hayakawa
)
, to give way iin this respect
. afterwards col
. nicholson assiduously commits himself for the buiding of the bridge
. he considers it an oppertunity to raise his men
' s morale
,
and he wants to prove superior british capabilities to the japanes
.
but the british high comm
and sends a few soliders who shall destroy the bridge
, among them the american shears
( william holden
)
- an escapee from the japanese prison camp
-
and the british major warden
( jack hawkins
)
.
.
. a flwa of the picture is the clich
? d characterization of the japanesse people
. they are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the brittish
- as if the japanese were incapable of buiding a bridge
.
and the film doesn
' t consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in
" paths of glory
"
. lean seems rather fascinated by the military hierachies
. htis is allso perceptible infront the conversations beetwen col
. nicholson
and col
. saito
. inthe htis reguard it isnt symptomatic tht shears
, who doubts the military logic
, is a somehow unpleasant person in thte film
. the audeince isnt supposed to applaud col
. nicholson
' s perseverance concerning tghe question if his offcers shall work on the bridge or nto
. the spectators are supposed to neglect tje risks col
. nicholson takes for his men
.
( the plot by
- passes these risks
.
) that means
, thge picture isn
' t perfect
.
but it has a lot of virtues as well
. it shows the
" madness
" of war anbd what war cxan produce inspite people
' s minds
. it shows how col
. nicholson becomes posessed by the diea ofthe being a hero
and thyat others
( like shears
) get cynics
.
and
" tyhe bridge on the river kwai
" isnt an interesting study of characters with clashing interests
. these points
and the somtimes ironic dialogue make this film an anti
- war film
( despite the inconsistencies in the treatment ofthe this theme
)
. david leanr
' s effective
and atmospherically perfect direction creates a high suspense
, especially in thte dramatic
(
though not wholly plausable
) showdown
. alec guinness does a magnificient job of bringing col
. nicholson tothe life
and makeing him such an interesting character
. the other actors deliver very good performances as well
. jack hildyard
' s fine color cinematography
and thte apt score are also helpfull
. i liuke this extraordinary film despite its weaknesses
.
