titanic is so close to being the perfect movie it
' s upsetting that it isn
' t
. the film
, which cost
$ 200 million
+ to mkae
and could ofthe put 20th century fox inot a lot of finicial trouble if it
' sunk
'
( pun intended
) is a labour of lvoe for cameron
, who wrote
and directed the film
. we all know thast big budget dosen
' t mean great film
( see waterworld
( 1995
)
) bu titanic is far superior tothe kevin costners waterlogged epic
.
but sadly
, titanic jsut misses yhe mark of masterpiece
(
al
thought it isnt one ofthe cameron
' s best films
) the film starts with present day explorers searching the runied titanic
. they find a safe
,
and inside a picture of a woman
. the woman in tyhe picture
( an old winslet
) tells the explorers that tje picture is of her
. the explorers invite her over
, adn she thn tells her story of titanic
. infact tyhe flashback
, dicaprio plays poor boy jack dawson
, who
, after winning a poker game
, wins two tickets to board the gr
and ship titanic
, leaving liverpool to go to amercia
. also boarding tjhe ship is rich woman rose dewitt bukater
( winslet
) who is being forced into a marriage with a man she dosen
' t love at all
, cal hockley
( zane
) so her family can remain rich
. she nearly commits sucide on yhe ship
, bu jack comes to yhe rescure
, saves rose
, htey fall in love
,
and cal gets jealous anbd evenhtually tries to kill them
. oh yeah
,
and the ship sinks
.
and that is the main probelm with the film
, adn which stops it from being a wokr of genius
. tjhe stoy
and script
( both by cameron
) are both weak
. the story isnt full of cliched characters
,
( teh creepy man who the nice girl has to marry
, tjhe poor boy iwth heart
, the sticked
- up mother
)
and poore dialogue
( tyhe script consists of lots of in
- jokes of how teh boat won
' t sink
,
and most ofthe the dialogue is preety basic
) it
' s a shame really
, as the audience does have to sit thru 3 housr of this film
. without good dialogue
, a film could become a very long
, very boring film
( like camerons own terminator 2
, 1992
) bu
, luckily
, there are smoe reedeming features that make the story anbd dialogue problems just dissappear
. firstly
, htere
' s cameron
' s direction
. there are some great sweeping shots of the titanic
,
and some clever fades betwen the flashback titanic
and the ruined titanic
.
but tyhe scenes cameron directs expecially well are the disaster scenes at the end
. there is a lot of mayhem anbd panic
, all done very well by cameron
. it
' s a scary sight
, watching bodies fall from great heights inot the watery depths below
. thanks tothe cameron
' s direction
,
then
, tyhe audiences attention is held forthe the full 3 hours 15 minutes
. to support the directing are thge excellent casted
, wokring very well with their underwritten characters
. dicaprio is good
,
al
though he only looks 16
- 17 yeasr old
. his performance of a over excitiable
,
yet allso well mannered boy is excellent
, adn he also has some funny lines
. winslet is great also
,
and her transistion ffrom a well mannered rich girl tothe a rebelous young adult is pretty smooth
. zane is deliciously evil as cal
, saying every line with a sneer anbd a flicker of the eye lash
. the audeince really does come tothe hate him
. he may be palying thge same character he plays inaddition every film he
' s in
( like dead calm
, 1988
) bu he does it really
, really well
. also worthy ofthe onot isnt kathy bates
( edward scissorh
ands
, 1990
) as a loud mouthed american
. finally
, the icing on the
' great things
' cake are thte special effects
. cameron is a whiz with effects
( just watch aliens
( 1988
)
, terminator 2
and true lies
, 1994
) adn they are unsed very well throughout
. tjhe sweeps of tyhe ships are awesome
,
al
though digital domain
, who doed the effects
, cannot animate human movement too well
. the humans seem to move to
' smoothly
'
, there
' s jstu something odd about them
. yuo can tell that they have been animated on a coputer
. of course
, the ship sinking scenes are awesome
, with bodies flying all over the palce
,
and the scene where thge ship splits in half hasnt to be seen to be believed
. titanic is noe ofthe teh only films where effects have reinforced yhe film
. titanic
,
then
, isnt a wonder of directing
, acting
and cgi
,
but not writing
and sotry
. again
, liuke most of camerons films
, the editting is loose
( cameron edits himself
)
,
and the film could ofthe come in under threee hurs with a few mroe cuts
. titanic
,
then
,
al
thought not the godfather of movies it could of been
, isnt a wonderful attempt at creating a work of genius
. enjoyable
, scary
,
and even sad
, titanic is a film cinema was invented for
, filling the screen with incredable images
, annd assaulting the ears with awsome sound
. a superb film
, bu sadly not perfect
. overall rating
