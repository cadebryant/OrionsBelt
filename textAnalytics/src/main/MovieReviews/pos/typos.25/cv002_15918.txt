you
' ve got mail works alot better tahn it deserves to
. in order tothe make the film a success
, all tehy had to do was casted two extremely popular
and attractive stars
, have them share thge screen fo about two hours
and thne collect the profits
. no real acting was involved
and there is not an orginial or inventive bone in it
' s body
( it
' s basicaly a complete re
- shoot of the shop around the corner
, onyl adding a faw modern twists
)
. essentially
, it goes agaisnt
and defies all concepts of good contemporary filmmaking
. it
' s overly sentimental
and at times terribly mushy
, not tothe mention vrey manipulative
.
but oh
, how enjoyable that manipulation is
. bu there must be something otehr than the casting
and manipulation tath makes tghe movie work as well as it does
, because i absolutly hated the previvous ryan
/ hanks teaming
, sleepless in seattle
. it couldn
' t have been tghe directing
, because both films were helmed by the smae woman
. i haven
' t quite
yet figured out whta i liked so much about you
' ve got mail
,
but
then again
, is tht raelly important
? if you like something so much
, why even question it
? again
, the storyline is as cliched as they come
. tom hanks plays joe fox
, thge insanely likeable owner of a discount book chain
and meg ryan plays kathleen kelley
, the even more insanely likeable proprieter of a family
- run children
' s book shop called
, in a nice homage
, the shop around the corner
. fox
and kelley soon become bitter rivals because the new fox books store is opening uv right across the block from the small business
. littel do they know
, they are alreday in love with each other over thte internet
, only neither party knows the other person
' s true identity
. the rest of the story isn
' t important because all it does is serve as a mere backdrop forthe the two stars to share tje screen
. sure
, there are soem mildly intresting subplots
, bu they all fail in comparsion tothe the utter cuteness of the main relationship
. all ofthe this
, of course
, leads up tothe the predictable climax
.
but as forseeable as tjhe endig isnt
, it
' s so damn cute
and well
- done tath i doubt any movie in the entire yearm containes a scene tghe evokes as much pure joy as this part does
. when ryan dicovers the true identity of her online love
, i wass filled witht such
, forthe lack of a better owrd
, happiness that for the first time all year
, i acutally left the theather smiling
.
