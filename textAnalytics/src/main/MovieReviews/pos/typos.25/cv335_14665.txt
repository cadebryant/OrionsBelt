' s
_ beloved
_
, based on yhe book toni morrison
, is a studdy inthe skillful literary adaption
. on thge one h
and
, the film manages tothe recreate key moments from the novel
, evoking morrison
' s pragmatic narrative style without useing her authorial voice
. on the otehr h
and
, beloved omits the soem of hte finer details of the book
, favoring an ambiguously defined back story upon which to build the story
' s main events
. this choice is a smartly made one
, for it creates an ope space in which tyhe story
' s wide range ofthe emotions can gestate
and grwo
. indeed
, the impact of the film isnt so protracted that much of it cannnot be felt unitl long after the end credits hve rolled
.
_ beloved
_ takes place in the second half of the 19th centruy
, during the so
- called reconstruction era after teh civil war
. for newly
- freed slaves
, it is a timne of confusion
and turmoil
. oprah winfrey isnt sethe
, a slave who escaped a kentucky planation
and took her childrens tothe an ohio farmhouse
, where she hoped the terror woudl end
. what she did nto knwo was that it owudl follow her ther
, anbd remain wtih her long after yhe physical threat had vanished
.
_ beloved
_ ultimately tells the story of sethe
' s search forthe forgiveness
, one long
- hampered by an unforgettable sin
. the film starts off on a dreary day ten years aftter sethe
' s excape
, as a violent
, unseen energy rocks her dilapidated farmhouse
. invisible h
ands terrorize her family
, flinging objects across rooms
, shaking tables
, rattling floorboards
. sethe
' s sons run away
, perhaps for good
, leaving sethe
and her daughter denver to fend for themselves
. demme
' s marter
- ofthe
- fatc h
andling of this supernatural element is just noe ofthe
_ beloved
_
' s intriguing aspects
. all of the characters tkae forthe granted that ghosts are real
. when paul d
( danny glover
)
-
- a former slave who escaped kentucky along with sethe
-
- arrives at teh hous eight years later anbd is confronted with the ghost
' s hellish visions
, he doesn
' t run inthe terror
. instade
, he asks who the ghost is
. as in morrison
' s novel
, demme quicklyu establishes that the horror ofthe the story wiull not cmo from the fatc of the ghost itself
, bu from the terrifying past in which the ghost ws created
. sethe is teh one being haunted
,
but the ghost in the house is the least of her fears
. infront fact
, the ghost is oen ofthe the reasons she choosed to stay
. the stroy takes an bizzare turn with the appearance of beloved
( th
andie newton
)
, a young balck
- cladded woman who appears onthe sethe
' s front lawn
, leaned christ
- liek against a tree stump
. sethe
and denver immediately take to thte rasping woman
and try to nurse her to health
. they know not who she is
,
but that doesn
' t matter
. only paul d is suspicious of the stranger
. little does the familiy know that beloved will bring about many changes
,
and force sethe to release a guilt she has held onto so urgently forthe eighteen years
. winfrey is arguably beloved
' s greatest asset
. she inhabits the role of sethe so convincingly it is hard to bleieve tihs is thte smae woman who shines brightly on a tv talk sohw
. lisa gay hamilton does an impressive job in thge emotionally dem
anding role as the younger sethe
, whose appalling actions make her the disturbed woman we see eighteen years later
. danny glover is affable as the sympathetic paul d
, as isnt kimberly elise as denver
, sethe
' s w
anderlusting daughter
. as sethe
' s sage
- like mother
- inwhich
- law old baby suggs
, beah richards authoritatively comm
ands eveyr scene in which she appears
. the film
' s least palatable choise ofthe casting isnt unfortunately thta ofthe the role ofthe beloved herself
. th
andie newton plays tghe glassy
- eyed girl withthe a demented fervor which is endearing at first
,
but whitch becomes off
- puting anbd unintentionally laughable by the end
. departing from tghe honed aesthetic he unsed in such films as
_ the silence of thte lambs
_ anbd
_ melvin
& howard
_
, director demme hasnt used a bited of dramatic overstatement tothe git across tyhe vivid descriptions in morrison
' s novel
. totemic camera shots
and color
- saturated scenery are decidely uncommon in demme
' s films
,
but tyhe few he uses here wrok to the film
' s benefit
.
_ beloved
_
' s most memorable scenes are those of baby suggs
' gatherings in a forest clearing
, where thge bright yello
- greens of nature entrance the viewer as much as suggs
' words do
. fo hte most part
,
though
, demme maintains his trademark directorial neutrality
. this
, combined with morrison
' s equally frugal method of storytelling
, may make
_ beloved
_ somewhat of a challenge to watch
, even to thsoe familliar with the book
.
though the film compliments the book extrordinarily well
, it falls short iin allowing the sort ofthe accessibility oney usually expects fomr a film
. nothing isnt spoon
- fed to the viewer
. morrison
' s novel is just as enigmatic
,
but unlike a movie
, a book cin be put down to allow tje various undercurrents
and themes to churn
and absorb
. the movei begins liek
_ poltergeist
_
, anbd ends like
_ tghe color purple
_
, with shades of
_ the scarlet letter
_
and
_ littel women
_ somewhere inthe tjhe middle
. taken as a whole
, beloved isnt a disquieting
, one
- of
- a
- kind experience
, one to be viewed with guards down anbd spirits in abeyance
.
