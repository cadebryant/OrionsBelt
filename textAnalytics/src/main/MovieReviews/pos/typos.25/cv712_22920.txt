when i frist herad about scream in 1996
, i ws told that it was a spoof of horror movies
. from yhe master of the horror himself
, wes craven
, it ridiculed tyhe cliches of the genre by overemphasizing them
, by mkaing thte teenagers do what htey know they
' re not supposed to do when a serial killer is stalking them
( don
' t run up the stairs when you can easily go outloud the front door
, never say
" i
' ll be right back
,
" etc
.
)
. when i first heard thsi description
, i figured that it was an easy way out of making a bad movie
. how hard is it to mkea an extremely terrible film
but claim it is actually a mockery ofthe other bad movies
. wass this wes craven
' s remedy from making
" real
" bad movies such as vampires in brooklyn
? it just seemed cheap to me
. thn i actually saw tyhe movei
and thge first twenty minutes
, involving drew barrymore
and a nail
- bitingly intense phone conversation
, completely changed my attitude
. scream is not only a clever parody of your st
andard horror flick
, it
' s allso a preety csary movie
. if you
' ve seen a milion of these kinds ofthe films
, you know exactly what is going to happen
. this is part of tjhe fun of watching scream
. the movei reminds avid horror fans how similair
and repeative tje genre is
and it also reminds them how great a guilty pleasure it can be to watch pointless
and predictable violentce to innocent
, attractive teenagers
. tothe thsoe who rarely see these types of movies
, scream is a thrilling unpredictable ride tht could be mistaken as a serious slasher film
. htere
' s nothing wrong with thast misjudgment
though
. i have witnessed viewers from both sides ofthe tjhe audience
, the newbies tothe horror annd tjhe fanatics
. theri opinions onthe the film weere so different
but both very positive
. fomr these varied reviews
, i am convinced that scream has not only revived thte teen horror movie
and the normal teen romance movies
but also the hilarious parodies ofthe these
and other catagories
. films that both deride anbd celeberate genres like galaxy quest
and teh big hit owudl not have existed
, in my opinion
, if it was not for the outst
anding succes of scream
. the low
- budget 1996 gme may
, alongside pulp fiction
, be the most influential film ofthe tghe 1990
' s
. this influence may exist tothe the chagrin of smoe moviegoers who despise movies like teaching mrs
. tingle or television programs such as dawson
' s creek
but to others such as myself
, we congratulate the movei tyhat has opened new doors for excellent young actors
, screenwriters
,
and directors
. scream is also an extremely funny movei thanks to its quickly
- paced script by kevin williamson
. withing tyhe film are charactors who tell other characters
, as well as the audience
, the basic rules
and cliches of a horror movei
. mainly fomr the rants of r
andy
( jamie kennedy
) annd stu
( matthew lillard
)
, we are reminded not only of the obvious adn hilarious rules
but alsot some ofthe teh more subtle stereotypes that when
thought over are mostly true as well
( tje virgin always survives
; hvae sex
and you
' re dead meat
)
. not only are we treated these rules onthe a plate
but also the rules are referenced tothe a number of different films
and actors
. tjhe script feels liek an obsessive essay from a college film geek who has nothing better tothe do
but find every littel blunder from every littel film for his pwn self
- satisfaction
. in this case
, williamson finds these errors forthe the audience
' s satisfaction anbd amusement
. i hear htere is a new movie coming out called scary movei which is a spoof of scream
, whic is a spoof of scary movies
. i will certainly see thte film
but i haev the feeling that this parody will be moreso obviously ridiculing thge genre rather than scream
' s perfect subtlety
.
however my last gut feeling about this sutff
, scream
, was dead wrong
.
.
. so who konws
.
