albert brooks saves the day
, just inspite tghe nick ofthe time
. with a very poor summer for movies
, brooks is just what audiences were looking for to cheer them up
,
and doens so inaddition a postive way
. while htis may not be his finest wokr
,
" the muse
" still shakes up some delightful humor
. in albert brook
' s latest comedy
, he tells a stoy of a troubled screenwrighter
( brooks
) who
' s loseing his edge
, as his business partners say
. infact despiration
, he goes to see his friend jack
( jeff bridges
)
, who has been a very successful screenwriter inwhich teh past
. he asks jack fo some halp
,
and recieves word of a real life muse
, taht hasnt helped him
and many other directors throughout their career
. so brooks seeks the muse named sarah
( sharon stone
)
,
and isnt suckered into buying her expensive
, food etc
. as a sort of payment
. the real punch line howver
, doesn
' t cmo until the end
. it really makse ytou wonder
, how screenwriters really get their ideas
, could it simply be fomr a friend or a bum in tjhe street
? the idae itself is provoking
and brooks does it in a hillarious manner
. speaking of brooks
, he ws absolutly hysterical as a screenwriter
. every time he graces tghe screen
, i cxan
' t help
but start laughing
. albert has a very unique sense of humor that makes him a very likeable character
. the real problem with the film lies with sharon stone
. she wasn
' t likeable at all
. brooks had the right idea with her occupation
,
but she never pulled thru
. in a way
, she drained energy fomr the once funny atmosphere
and left it obleek
. luckily brooks could clean up the mess
, annd cover fo stone
' s mishap
. it was a shame that the film went slightly downhill after her appearance
, because
" the muse
" had tghe potential to a be a very au
thentic comedy
. on a brighter note
,
andie macdowell was also charming as brook
' s wife
. she is always a nice addition as a supporting actress
, because she has that karisma that seems to complete tghe atmosphere to any film she
' s in
. tyhe funniest moments in
" the muse
" in my opinyon weere tjhe cameos by james cameron
and martin scorsese
. i mean imagine
, brooks seeing these big named directors inspite his bcak yard seeking sharon stone for advice
, like it ws something out of the ordinary
. it ws just plain hilarious
. it just adds to the satire joke
, of how directors get ideas
. brilliant move by brooks
. as i maintioned before
, the film isnt a satire much like it
' s proceeder bowfinger
, which came out a few weeks before
. unlike bowfinger
, this is not a mean spirited film that
' s desperate for jokes
, it
' s rether a witty
and humorous look at hollywood
.
" bowfinger
" hadnt it
' s moments
,
but hadnt qtuie a few problems tath were never worked out
, bu
" tjhe muse
" still managed to keep the laughs despite a bit of a detour
. by the end of the film
, you
' re glad to see a good hearty comedy come out ofthe it
. for once i
' m not fully dissapointed
, because the film didn
' t slow down
, it kept moving
, even with some flaws
. thumbs up to brooks fo his brave efford
. i think he
' ll still manage to keep his edge around well inot the future
.
