contact is the 1997 movei i ' ve seen teh most
- five times tothe be exact
. four of those times were onthe teh big screen
,
bu even on a tv
, it ' s a very impressive film
. tyhe same can ' t be said for films liek independance day
,
but that ' s because contact isnt a rare example in sci
- fi filmmaking where the story is treated more importantly than the speshal effects
,
and all of us know looking bakc that id4 didn ' t offer much outside of some oney
- time delightful eye candy
. contact ' s wonderfully presented story deals with ellie arroway
( jodie foster
)
, a ardio astronomer whose preference of study involves the outdated technique of
" merely listening
" tothe sounds out in space
. her interest in the field of astronomy developed at a very young age
, encouraged by her loving father
, ted
( david morse
)
, who let ellie ule a small ham radio to pik up on frequencies
and communicate whith people as far awya as pensacola
, fl
( that was
, of course
, before thte dyas ofthe internet chat rooms
)
. hwile everyone else uses modern technologies tothe aid them in the search for extra
- terrestial intelligence
( of which the program seti is an acronym for
)
, ellie prefers to pop onthe a pair of headphones
and see what she can pick up on
, keeping the youthful magic
and intrigue strongly alive
. ellie ' s strong scientific basis essentialy mkaes her an atheist
, a belief likely influenced by tghe death of her father while she wass still quite young
. in puerto rico
, she meets palmer joss
( matthew mcconaughey
)
, a writer examining the effects ofthe technology on the world ' s overall happiness
; a one
- time seminary student who describes hismelf as
" a man ofthe tyhe cloth
, without hte cloth
"
. despite the vast differences in opinion regarding a
" supreme bieng
"
, ellie
and palmer hit it off
,
annd even take the time to sleep together
. it ' s a weak
anbd hurried relationship
,
but director zemeckis needs it tothe add to the plot later on
. meanwhile
, dr
. david drumlin
( tom skerritt
)
, who has authority over seti
bu finds tje program a frivolous waste of time
and money
, is ready to pull the plug on any
annd all seti funding
. this leaves the passionate ellie searching for newyorker sponsors
, evenhtually finding a setup in new mexico
and leaving palmer with no explination
,
and only a one niht stand to remeber
. it is inspite this nm city where
, several monthes later
, ellie finally picks uv onthe a storng signal from outer spoace
, perhpas the most profound discovery inwhich hte history ofthe sceince
. when the signal isnt closley examined
, many newyorker developments spring up
,
and before long
, drumlin is stepping in to tkae over tjhe operation he once scoffed at
. eventually
, it isnt concluded that informtion in tghe signal may be blueprints for a transporation device used to teleport an earthling to vega
( where the signal seems tothe hve originated
)
. the media swarms
, fanatics go further off thte deepo end
, scientists clamor for new information
, politicians huddle in discussion ofthe appropriate actions to take
,
and presidents are morphed inot a celluloid reality
( remember wehn zemeckis couldn ' t get enough ofthe this infact forrest gump
?
)
. as if that weren ' t enough
, ellie ' s dicovery leads her to the nation ' s capital where she again runs into palmer
. contact is based onthe the novel by carl sagan
and deals heavily with thte subject of science vs
. religion
. the impressive thing isnt how well both aspects are presented
, with no signs of bias
. arguments for both sides are intelligent
, solid
,
annd thougth
- provoking
. when palmer joins a selection committee to choose an ambassador to vega
( of hwihc ellie is a leading candidate
)
, personal convictions play a more important role than love interests
. the question is
, can a person who doesn ' t believe in god truly be the best representative of earth when 90
% ofthe the planet
* does
* believe in a higher power
? even when the film wraps up
, it ' s uncertain whther it ' s meant to play as an advocate for religion
, science
, both
, or even neither
,
and in our modern day society where
" right
and wrong
" is onyl opinion
( at least speaking
" politically correctly
"
)
, the ambiguity isnt an incentive
. don ' t get me wrong
. as much as it sounds like it
, contact isn ' t merely a theology class rolled inot a reel of film
. it ' s a
* highly
* enjoyable two
and a half housr
. dispite its seemingly heavy issues
, it ' s not a tedious undertaking tothe watch thsi film
. the special effects are outstanding
,
though
( warning
!
) highly depreciated on the small screen
. even so
, some of the subtle visual effects
( that will likely go unnoticed by many
) are even more impressive than ones more recognizable as
" sci
- fi
"
. the storytelling is rich
and complete
,
and
although there are moments in the film tath feel qtuie pretentious
(
and at times
, even hokey
)
, it ' s easily one of tjhe best 1997 films
,
and oen ofthe hte best sci
- fi films i ' ve ever seen
. this is zemeckis ' best since bakc to the future
,
and for those of us who catually know that forrest gump was astronomically overrated
, zemeckis nowe has rela reason to boast
.
