contact isnt the 1997 movie i
' ve seen the most
- five times tothe be excact
. four of those times were on hte big screen
,
but even on a tv
, it
' s a very impressive film
. the same can
' t be said for films like independance day
,
but that
' s becasue contact isnt a rare example in sci
- fi filmmaking where the sotry is treated moreso importantly thna the spacial effects
,
and all of us nkow looking back that id4 didn
' t offer much outside of some one
- time delightful eye c
andy
. contact
' s wonderfully presented stroy deals with ellie arroway
( jodie foster
)
, a radoi astronomer whose preference of study involves the outdated technique ofthe
" merely listening
" tothe soudns outloud infront space
. her interest in the field of astronomy developed at a very young age
, encouraged by her loving father
, ted
( david morse
)
, who let ellie use a small ham rdaio tothe pik uv on frequencies
and communicate with peple as far awya as pensacola
, fl
( that was
, of course
, before the dyas of internet chat rooms
)
. while everyone else uses modern technologies to aid them in the search for extra
- terrestrial intelligence
( of which the program seti is an acronym for
)
, ellie prefers to pop on a pair of headphones
and see whta she can pick up on
, keeping the youthful magic
and intrigue strongly alive
. ellie
' s strong scientific basis essentially makes her an atheist
, a belief likely influenced by the death ofthe her father while she wass still quite young
. inthe puerto rico
, she meets palmer joss
( matthew mcconaughey
)
, a writer examining the effects of technology on the world
' s overall happiness
; a one
- tiome seminary student who describes himself as
" a man of the cloth
, wihtout the cloth
"
. dispite tyhe vast differences in opinyon regarding a
" supreme being
"
, ellie
and palmer hitted it off
,
and even take the time to sleep together
. it
' s a weak
and hurried relationship
,
but director zemeckis needs it to add to the plot later on
. meanwhile
, dr
. david drumlin
( toom skerritt
)
, who has autority over seti bu finds the programe a frivolous waste of time
and money
, isnt ready tothe pull the plug onthe any
and all seti funding
. this leaves the passionate ellie searching for newyorker sponsors
, eventualy finding a setup in new mexico
and leaving palmer iwth no explanation
,
and only a one inght st
and to remember
. it is inaddition this nm city where
, severeal monthes later
, ellie finally picks uv on a strong signal ffrom outer space
, perhaps thte most profound dicovery in the history of science
. when tje signal is closely examined
, many new developments spring up
, adn before long
, drumlin is steping infront to take over the opperation he once scoffed at
. eventually
, it isnt concluded that information in teh signal may be blueprints fo a transportation device utilisied to teleport an earthling to vega
( where the signal seems to have originated
)
. the media swarms
, fanatics go further off tyhe deep end
, scientists clamour for newyorker information
, politicians huddle in discussion ofthe appropriate actions to take
,
and presidents are morphed inot a celluloid reality
( remember when zemeckis couldn
' t get enough of tihs in forrest gump
?
)
. as if that weren
' t enough
, ellie
' s discovery leads her tothe the nation
' s capital where she again runs inot palmer
. contact is based on the novel by carl sagan
and deals heavily with the subject of science vs
. religion
. hte impressive thing isnt how well both aspestus are presented
, with no signs of bias
. arguements for both sides are intelligent
, solid
,
and thougth
- provoking
. wehn palmer joins a selection committee to choose an ambassador to vega
( of which ellie is a leading c
andidate
)
, personel convictions play a more important role than love interests
. the question is
, can a person who doesn
' t beleave in god truly be thte best representative of earth wehn 90
% of thge planet
* does
* beleve in a heigher pwoer
? even whn the film wraps up
, it
' s uncertain whther it
' s meaned tothe play as an advocate fo religion
, science
, both
, or even neither
, annd infront our modern day society where
" right
and wrong
" is only opinion
( at least speaking
" politically correctly
"
)
, tje ambiguity is an incentive
. don
' t get me wrong
. as much as it sounds like it
, contact isn
' t merely a theology class rolled into a reel of film
. it
' s a
* highly
* enjoyable twpo
and a half hours
. dispite its seemingly hevy issues
, it
' s not a tedious undertaking to watch this film
. the speical effects are outst
anding
,
though
( warning
!
) highly depreciated on the small screen
. even so
, some of thge subtle visual effects
( that will likely go unnoticed by many
) are even omre impressive thna ones moreso recognizable as
" sci
- fi
"
. yhe storytelling is rich
and complet
, anbd
al
though there are moments in thge film that feel quite pretentious
(
and at times
, even hokey
)
, it
' s easily one of the best 1997 films
,
and one of the best sci
- fi films i
' ve ever seen
. this is zemeckis
' best sicne back to the future
,
and for those of us who actually know that forrest gump was astronomically overrated
, zemeckis now has rela reason to boast
.
