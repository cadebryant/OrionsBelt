" series at www

[ light spoilers
, nothing you shouldn
' t read
] existenz has beeen called
" a gooey matrix
"
,
and while this is a correct discription in some ways
, in others it is completly off
. hte onyl thing tje two films have in common is the idea of a virtual reality that is indistinguishable from normal
,
" real
" reality
. a major difference is that
" the matrix
" has a base reality that is obviously the true reality
, hwile existenz does the impossible
and makes us accept the most bizarre reality ever as true
.
and oh what a reality it is
. david cronenberg has shown us before thyat he knows how to create strange movies
( naked lunch
, crash
)
, bu this noe is one ofthe the strangest
. maybe it
' s because of how the mundane is mixed with the bizarre
. technnology is organic
, bu only some of it
. cars are normal
. gas stations are the same
. cell phones are glowing bug liek appendages
. yuo jack into a virtual reality game useing a quivering pink gooey animal like apparatus
( referred to simply as a
" pod
"
)
. high technology has been replaced with organic creatures
,
and it provides a truly surreal setting for tghe charactors
. a famous game designer
, allegra geller
( a fine looking jennifer jason leigh
)
, flees a demonstration of her latest game
, existenz
, after an assasinations attempt
. she is on yhe run
( from who
, i
' m still not sure
)
,
and has to save her pod by palying her game withthe
" someone freindly
"
. that someone friendly is her dubious companion
and security guard
, ted pikul
( jude law
)
. unfortunately he is lacking a fundametal requirement for playing
, a bioport
. sort ofthe a hole infact your spine
( ok
, exactly like a hole inwhich your spine
)
, a bioport allows you to plug the vaguely entrail
- looking wires from the pod into you
, alowing you to play tyhe game
. luckily a bioport can be installed easily
( they install them in malls
)
, so off they go to get oney
. aftter a crazy sories ofthe events at the local ocuntry gas station
, they are able tothe plug in
and play existenz
. tghe plot itself is a surreal melding ofthe conspiracies
, reality distortion
, chineese restaurants
, annd multi appendaged anphibian thnigs
(
" it
' s a sign of the times
"
)
.
but the plot
, while cohesive infact it
' s own creepy way isnt secondary tothe just trying to figure out what the hell is going on in this universe
. cronenberg just slaps htis weird organic
- tech world into the viewers lap
, adn it
' s up to ytou to figure out how all these things work
. adn that
' s thge true joy of this film
, entering the vaguely nightmarish world in which existenz takes place
. you leran a littel bit peice by piece
( oh
, they make pods out of thsoe
)
,
and it
' s just enough to get ytou tothe accept the world thgat isnt presented tothe ytou
. there are all kinds ofthe twists
and turns as the characters w
ander arround
, including a fantastic scene in a chinese restaurant that will leave you trying to assemble something outloud ofthe your moo goo gai pan for months afterwords
. also yhe bioports are occasionally utilisied for things other than porting into existenz
, the specifics of which i will leave fo yuo tothe discover
. there
' s lots of littel things that set off the weird
- o
- meter
, like the little tiny pods that you can buy inaddition the video game stoer
, the two headed amphibian creature
,
and why that guy at the gas staion
' s name appears to be
" gas
"
. it all adds up to a supremely far outloud trip
,
and given the choice i thikn i would rether live in thte matrix
' s virtual world
.
.
. oh wait
, i alreday do
.
