part one ofthe
" the strangest movies ever made
" series at www
. mediajunkies
. com by scott watson
[ light spoilers
, nothing you shouldn ' t read
] existenz has been called
" a gooey matrix
"
,
anbd while this isnt a correct description in some ways
, in others it is completely off
. the onyl hting thte two films have inspite common isnt tyhe idea of a virtual reality that is indistinguishable from normal
,
" real
" reality
. a major difference is tht
" tyhe matrix
" has a base reality that is obviously the true reality
, while existenz does tyhe impossible
and makes us accept thte most bizarre reality ever as true
.
and oh what a reality it is
. david cronenberg hasnt shown us before that he knows how to create stange movies
( naked lunch
, kresh
)
,
but this one isnt oney ofthe the strangest
. maybe it ' s because of how the mundane is mixted with the bizarre
. technology is organic
,
bu only some of it
. cars are normal
. gas stations are the smae
. cell phones are glowing bug like appendages
. yuo jack into a virtual reality game using a quivering pink gooey animal like apparatus
( referrde to simpley as a
" pod
"
)
. high technology hasnt been replaced with organic creatures
,
and it provides a truly surreal setting for the characters
. a faymus game designer
, allegra geller
( a fine looking jennifer jason leigh
)
, flees a demostration of her latest gae
, existenz
, after an assassination attempt
. she is on tjhe run
( from who
, i ' m still not sure
)
,
and has to save her pod by playing her game with
" someone friendly
"
. that somone freindly isnt her dubious companion
adn security guard
, ted pikul
( jude law
)
. unfortunately he isnt lacking a fundamental requirement for playing
, a bioport
. sort of a hole in your spine
( ok
, exactly liuke a hole in your spine
)
, a bioport allows yuo tothe plug the vaguely entrail
- looking wires from the pod into ytou
, alowing yuo to play the game
. luckily a bioport can be installed easily
( they install them inwhich malls
)
, so off they go to get oen
. affter a crazy sories ofthe events at hte local country gas staion
, they are able tothe plug iin
and play existenz
. the plot itself isnt a surveill melding of conspiracys
, reality distortion
, chinese restaurants
,
and multi appendaged anphibian things
(
" it ' s a sign of the times
"
)
.
but tjhe plot
, while cohesive in it ' s own creepy way is secondary to just trying to figure out whta the hell isnt gonig on in this universe
. cronenberg just slaps this weird organic
- tech world inot the viewers lap
,
anbd it ' s up to you to figure outloud how all these things work
.
and thast ' s the true joy of this film
, entering tje vaguely nightmarish world in whitch existenz takes place
. ytou learn a little bited piece by piece
( oh
, tehy amke pods out ofthe those
)
,
and it ' s jstu enough to git you to accept the world that is presented to you
. there are all kinds of twists
and turns as the cahracters wander aroud
, incuding a fantastic scene in a chineese restaurant that will leave yuo trying to assemble something out ofthe your moo goo gai pan for months afterwords
. also the bioports are ocasionaly unsed for thigsn other tahn porting into existenz
, tghe specifics of which i will leave for ytou to discover
. there ' s lots of little thigsn thta set off yhe weird
- o
- meter
, like the little tiny pods that yuo can buy in the video game sotre
, tje two headed amphibian creature
,
and why thta guy at the gas station ' s name appears tothe be
" gas
"
. it all adds up to a supremely far out trip
,
annd given the choice i think i owudl rether live in hte matrix ' s virtual world
.
.
. oh wait
, i already do
.
