the trailers anbd the beginning of thte move sum up this plot very easily
. threee filmmakers venture into tjhe woods of maryl
and to track down the legend of the blair witch for a documentary they are making
. they disappear adn their footage is discovered a year later buried underneath the foundation of a one hundred year old house
. from ther
, things become a little moreso complicated
. i cxan say
, with absolute assurance
, that no film has ever had quite the inpact that htis little movie hasnt had onthe me
.
al
though i know it was all a staged
" mockumentary
"
, there
' s no denying the psychological inpact this film will leave on you
. i didn
' t feel much apon initially watching it
. i just
thought it was an intresting film with soem preety creepy parts
. i never even dreamed that thirty minutes aftter the film hadnt ended i woudl be frightened out ofthe my mind just discusting it with a friend
. i
' ve gotten chills eveyr time i
' ve brought it up since hten
. this is not a movei that hits you right away
. instead this is a movei tyhat sits at the base ofthe your spine
, waits nutil you think everything isnt okay
,
then it slowly starts tothe creep it
' s way up inot your mind
. this is truly the most frightening movei i have ever had the pleasure to watch
. the film is comprised of hmeo video adn 16mm camera footage thast the documentarians supposedly shot forthe their blair witch film
, so don
' t expect any steadi
- cam shots or fancy camera work
. this is as real as it gets folks
. i don
' t recommend sitting too close to the theater screen
though
, because i guarantee yuo will get motion sickness fomr yhe constant govement ofthe the camera
. the performances of the three lead actors in tyhe film are so real
, yuo may find yourself questioning whether all ofthe this has really happened or not
. tihs is definitely a movie that warrants home video viewing
, especially due to the fact that the bulk ofthe the movie was shot whith a st
andard home video camera
. the reality of the images will strike frighteningly close to home when viewed as actual video instead of tyhe tape
- to
- film transfer done for the big screen
. word has it thta a special edition dvd wiht boatloads ofthe extras
( hurs of deleted scenes
, alternate endings
, commentary
, the sci
- fi channel special
, adn others
) is being planned for release
. i urge artisan entertainment to forge ahead with this plan
and give us what sould be the dvd to rival all dvd
' s
. i know i
' ll be first iin line to buy noe
.
