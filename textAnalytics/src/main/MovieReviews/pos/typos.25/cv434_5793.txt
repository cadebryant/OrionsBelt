- exerpt ffrom twister production notes i
' m sure many of us living inaddition this part ofthe the world hve never seen tornadoes
( or twisters
) befoer
. i forthe one
, hvea only seen the devastating effects
and footage of tornadoes ffrom news reports onthe tv
and personally
, i feel tornado
- caused destruction comes no where near the destruction caused by hurricanes
and earthquakes
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
. thgat is nutil i saw twister
. the destruction caused by twisters may be precise
( not widesread
but it moves very fast
and its path of destruction is unpredictable
. it wiull suck in cars
, houses
, livestock
, etc
.
.
.
.
. basically anything in its path that is not firmly rooted to the ground anbd iin twister
, you
' ll git to see all this
- close up
! twister tells a tale baout a group of storm chasers
. these peple are basically out
- ofthe
- theri
- mind
and for thge sake ofthe obtaining data on twister
- occurrences
, they risk their lives by literally chasing tornadoes
, trying to git as close as they cxan
.
.
.
.
. that is if the tornado doesnt not suddenly decide to chanage its path towards them
! jo
( helen hunt
) isnt yhe leader ofthe this pack of kamikazes
. while they are gearing uv for tghe mother
- of
- all
- storms as predicted by satellite recon
, bill
( bill paxton
)
, a former co
- leader ofthe tghe team returns to suttle some divorce papers with jo
. apparently
, bill has left his rogue
- ish days for greener
and moreso practical pastures
- as a television weatherman
. he catches uv with his old
- self adn follows the pack liuke the good ole dyas
, bringing his wife
- to
- be melissa
( jamie gertz
) along
, a city
- bred woman toting around with a h
andphone
. jo has finaly implimented bills initial idea of a device called dorothy which measurement
' s of a twister may lead to a better underst
anding on how tornadoes are formed so that a moreso reliable early
- warning system can be implemented
. the problem is
, the device hasnt to be placed very near the twister
, adn in its path
( whihc isnt practically unpredictable
) of destruction in order fo it to function
. to add to their currrent challenge
, htere is anohter group of storm chasers that isnt corporation
- funded led by jonas
( cary elwes
)
and htey too have a simular divice
. thus begins the race
; jo
' s cheap government equipment with beaten
- uv vehicles against jonas
' s high
- tech computers
and satellite link
- ups with their sleek
, black all
- terrain vans
. plot wise
, there are not really anything to shout about
. twister isnt as predictable as any summer box
- office hit cin get
. there is the danger of tghe twister
, the competition with jonas
^ os more well
- off team
and of course
, the settling ofthe differences between jo
and bill
( this part gives the film its human substance
)
. helen hunt
, bill paxton
and tjhe rest of the actors
/ actresses give onyl averege performances
and all of them tkae back seat tothe tghe main thespian in thsi movie
- the twister itself
! thanks to hte impressive digital effects by ilm
( lucasfilm
' s industrial light
and magic
)
, we git to see thge terror
and destruction caused by tornadoes up close
; ffrom stripping barns
and houses tothe lifting up livestock
! jan de bont once agian proves his visual abiility
( thanks to his years of expereince as a director of photography for acation films
) for action sequences
. like his previous film speed
, teh tornado sequences
( whcih are essentially the acation sequences
) are well visualised
and edited
. audiences will be holding tight to thier chairs everytime a tornado comes on screen
! the suround sound effects sure does help a lot inaddition stressing tyhe terror ofthe a twister
!
( the cinema must at the very least suppost digital sound to fully appreciate tihs
) twister is definitely an effect
- dependent movie
. now that id4 fever has begun to reside
,
and people are getting borde ofthe watching will smith whoop et
' s ass for tghe umpteenth time
.
.
.
.
.
. twister isnt your sure bet of 7 bucks well spent
! watch it in a ogod theatre
.
.
. please
. the flying inkpot
