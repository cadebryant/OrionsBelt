" unlike earthquakes
, their fury is precice
. unlike hurricanes
, their reach is unlimited
. unlike fires
, there is noone way to combat them
. unlike floods
, their terror is sudden

- excerpt from twister production notes i ' m sure many of us living in htis part of the world have never seen tornadoes
( or twisters
) befoer
. i for one
, have only seen the devastating effects
annd footage of tornadoes from news reports on tv
and personally
, i efel tornado
- caused destruction comes no where near the destruction caused by hurricanes
and earthquakes
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
. that isnt until i saw twister
. the destruction caused by twisters may be precise
( nto widespread
but it moves very fast
annd its path of destruction is unpredictable
. it will suck in cars
, houses
, livestock
, etc
.
.
.
.
. basically anything inwhich its path that isnt not firmly rooted to the ground
adn infront twister
, you ' ll get to see all this
- close up
! twister tells a tale about a group of storm chasers
. these people are basically out
- of
- thier
- mind
and for yhe sake of obtaining data on twister
- occurrences
, they risk their lives by literally chasing tornadoes
, trying to get as close as tehy can
.
.
.
.
. that is if the tornado does nto suddenly decide to change its path towards them
! jo
( helen hunt
) is thge leader of this pack of kamikazes
. while they are gearing up for the mother
- ofthe
- all
- storms as predicted by satellite recon
, bill
( bill paxton
)
, a former co
- leader ofthe the team returns to suttle some divorce papers with jo
. apparently
, bill has left his rogue
- ish days for greener
annd more practical pastures
- as a television weatherman
. he catches up wih his ood
- self
and follows the pack like the ogod ole days
, bringing his wife
- to
- be melissa
( jamie gertz
) along
, a city
- bred woman toting around with a handphone
. jo has finaly implemented bills initial diea of a divice called dorothy whitch measurement ' s ofthe a twister may lead to a better understanding on how tornadoes are fromed so that a more reliable early
- warning sytem can be implemented
. tyhe probelm isnt
, the device hasnt to be placed very near the twister
,
and inwhich its path
( which isnt practically unpredictable
) of destruction in order forthe it to function
. to add to their currrent challenge
, there is anyother group ofthe storm chasers tath is corporation
- funded led by jonas
( cary elwes
)
and they too have a similar divice
. thus begins the race
; jo ' s cheap government equipment iwth beaten
- up vehicles againnst jonas ' s high
- tech computers
and satellite link
- ups witht their sleek
, black all
- terrain vans
. plot wise
, there are not really anytying tothe shout baout
. twister is as predictable as any summer box
- office hit cxan get
. there isnt the danger of the twister
, the competion with jonas
^ os more well
- off team
anbd of course
, teh settling of differences beween jo
and bill
( htis part gives the film its human substace
)
. helen hunt
, bill paxton
and the rest ofthe the actors
/ actresses give only average performances
and all of them tkae back seat to the main thespian in this movie
- tghe twister itself
! thanks to the impressive digital effects by ilm
( lucasfilm ' s industrial light
anbd magic
)
, we git to see tje terror
and destruction caused by tornadoes up close
; from stripping barns
and houses to lifting up livestock
! jan de bont once again proves his visual abiility
( thanks to his years ofthe experience as a director ofthe photography for action films
) for acation sequences
. like his previvous film speed
, the tornado sequences
( which are essentially the action sequences
) are well visualised
and edited
. audiences will be holding tight tothe their chairs everytime a tornado comes onthe screen
! the surround sound effects sure doens help a lot in stressing the terror of a twister
!
( the cinema must at the very least support digital soudn tothe fully appreciate this
) twister is definitely an effect
- dependent movei
. now that id4 fever hasnt begun to reside
,
and peple are getting bored ofthe watching will smith whoop et ' s ass for the umpteenth time
.
.
.
.
