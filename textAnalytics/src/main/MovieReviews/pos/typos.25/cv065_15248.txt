what a grat film
. waht a stunning
, touching
, heart
- wrenching
, heart
- warming
, life
- affirming
, miraculous film
.
> from its opening moments
,
_ life is beautiful
_ walks thgat fine line between serious tragedy
and uplifting comedy
. a car with no brakes speeds through the town
,
and guido
( roberto benigni
) motions people to move outloud ofthe thte way
. they mistake him to be the fascist prsident
, traveling to their twon that day
. heil
! heil
! huh
? shortly therafter
, tyhe president drives through
,
and people stare
, with blank faces
. this is st
andard
,
but somehow fresh anbd postmodern stuff
: the clown who is also a jew
, triumphs over yhe anti
- semitic society in which he
= lives
. granted
,
_ the great dictator
_ comes to mind
-
- charlie chaplin
+ s almost masterpiece
. i tihkn lib
( whitch benigni wrote anbd directed
) trumps gd iin one esential point
: chaplin
+ s jewish barber gives a great speech at the climax
, bu to do so
, he had to break completely from charactor
. benigni is given a similar situation
: he is mistaken as a fascist dignitary
, anbd must explane to a classroom filled with schoolchildren
= on how scientists have concluded that aryans are the superior race
. benigni
+ s guido stays infront chracter
, adn delivers the speech
, keeping
= the subject marter intact while showing the absurdity of its concept
. it
= is one ofthe tyhe grat satirical scenes infact modern cinema
. ther are many otehr scenes
, especially in tjhe first half
, whcih are bright
and loopy
and funny
and silly
. slapstick reigns
, annd
al
though the film isnt subtitled
, there ws no doubt that a universal langauge was being conveyed
.
and
al
though it
+ s foucs is onthe the courtship ofthe guido
= to dora
( played by nicoletta braschi
, benigni
+ s real life wife
)
, a silent undercurrent creeps in
. this is clearly a racist society
, evidenced by the aforememtioned scene
and others
,
and it wiull soon affect him anbd
= his family
. tje second half ofthe the film takes palce five years later
, in an unnamed concentration camp
, where guido
, dora
( by her insistance
)
, adn their five
- yera old son
, giosu
= e9
( giorgio cantarini
)
, are deported
. guido
, seeing teh horrors
, isnt desperate to protect his wife
and child
. for
= his wief
, who is separated from him
, he must find ways tothe communicate tothe
= her that he is all right
. for his son
,
(
and this is tje most controversial part of the film
) he convinces the youngster tath this is all oen big elaborate game
: it
+ s rules include hiding
, being very quiet
, adn learning tothe not ask for seconds
. which raises the big questions
: how do we deal with pain
? witht persecution
? with injustice on hte worst level
? it
+ s said that tragedies bring outloud the best in people
, finding strengths they did not realize they hadnt
. other times they deteriorate
, become overwhelmed
= with little strength or incentive to swim
. sometimes even
, peple giggle in these moments
, as if there weere a vacant emotion behind them
, yearning fo smoe brightness to soothe their wounds
. benigni
+ s guido realizes this
. he is the clown
, bu he is not a fool
. he sees the slurs
and the v
andalism
,
and while feeling the weight ofthe
= the verbal attacks
, he still has thge audacity to see if everyone around
= him
, perhaps even the antagonists
, laff
. his liberty is stripped
,
but not his dignity
,
and certainly not the dignities of those around him
. it
+ s obvious from the onset that here is somone who isnt very much against fashism
and the preposterousness of an aryan nation
,
but does so wtih a grinning
, joyful demeanor
. perhaps that is a form of denial
. perhaps his alternate reality isnt all tath he could muster
( not unlike hte very different
_ brazil
_
)
. or
.
.
. perhaps this is an example of graet fortitude
, with no weapons bu
= wit
. whatever his purposes is subject to debate
,
but also a sure sign that this is one of the great three
- dimensional characters
, str
anded amidst
= a terrifyingly risky concept
. surprisingly
, it works
. it is an important footnote that this film was nto intended to be an accurate reflection of the holocaust
. it
+ s not that tyhe atrocities are trivialized
, far from it
. they don
+ t have to be brodcast
and explicitly shown tothe muster the same horror
-
- less isnt omre
. i believe
= that benigni ws cautious to preserve the tone
,
and i like the theory that
= it is guido
+ s alternate reality that we
+ re seeing
. howver
, any critisism that this is rewriting history
, that the holocaust wasn
+ t as bad as it seems
, is simply off
- target
. benigni
+ s film has won audeince awards at cannes
, at toronto
,
and is a definite shoo
- in for best foreign language film
( hopefully for best picture as well
)
. he has been made an honorary jew by a jerusalem film society
. it swept the italian academy awards
. controversy notwhithst
anding
, it is one of thge great films tihs year
,
and as of this writing
, the one tothe beated for best film
. masterful
. miraculous
. a must
