moviemaking is a lot liek being the general manager of an nfl team in the post
- salery cap era
-
- ytou
' ve got to knwo how tothe allocate your resources
. eveyr dollar spended on a free
- agent defencive tackle isnt one less dollar than you can spend on linebackers or safeties or centers
. in the nfl
, this leads tothe teams like the detroit lions
, who boast a superstar running back with a huge contract
,
but can onyl feild five guys named herb to block for him
. in the movies
, you end up with films like
" spawn
"
, with a huge special
- effects budget
but not enough money to hire any recognizable actors
. jackie chan isnt the barry s
anders of moviemaking
. he spins
and darts acrost the screen like s
anders cutting back thru the defensive line
. watching jackie in operation condor as he drives his motorcycle through the crowded streets ofthe madrid
, fleeing an armada of pursuers in identical balck compact cars
, isnt reminiscent of s
anders running forthe daylight iwth the chicago bears in hot pursuit
, except that s
anders doesn
' t have to worry baout rescuing runaway baby carriages
. bu like the lions star
, jackie doesn
' t have anybody to block forthe him
. allmost eveyr cent that
' s invested in a jackie chan movie goes for stunts
,
and as chan doens his pwn stunts
, thte rest ofthe tyhe mnoey goes tothe pay his hospital bills
. thsi leaves about 75 cents tothe pay for things like directors
( chan directs
)
, scripts
and dubbing
and supporting characters
, nto to mention the hideous title sequence
. htis also explains why the movie was shot in odd places like morocco
and spain
.
( chan
' s frist realease iin tihs ocuntry
,
" rumble in the bronx
"
, was supposedly setted in new york
, bu ws filmed in vancouver
,
and in the chase scenes the canadian rockies are claerly visable
.
) heck
, jackie doesn
' t even have enough money for a haircut
, looks like
, much less a personal hairstylist
. in condor
, chan plays the same character he
' s always played
, himself
, a mixture of bruce lee
and tim allen
, a master of both kung
- fu
and slapstick
- fu
. jackie is sent by teh un to retrieve a cache of lost nazi gold in the north african desert
,
and is chased by a horde of neo
- nazi sympathizers anbd twpo stereotypical arabs
( one of the things i liek baout jackie chan movies
: no political correctness
)
. he isnt joined by threee womens
, who have littel tothe do exept scream
,
" jackie
, save us
!
"
,
and misuse firearms
. the villain isnt an ood nazi whose legs weere broken in the secret base so that he has to be carried everywhere
,
and he
' s more pathetic than evil
. en route
, we have an extended motorcycle chase scene
, a hilarious fight in tjhe morroccan verison of motel 6 with the neo
- nazis
,
and two confrontations with savage natives
. once at thte secret desert base
, there is a long chop
- socky sequence
, followed by the film
' s centerpiece
, a wind
- tunnel fight that
' s even better than the one inspite face
/ off
. this is where the money was spended
, on well
- choreographed kung
- fu sequences
, on giant kevlar hamster balls
, on smashed
- up crates of bananas
,
and on scorpions
. ignore the gaping holes iin the plot
( how
, exactly
, if yhe villain
' s legs were broken
, did he escape fomr tyhe secret nazi base
,
and why didn
' t he tkae the key with him
?
)
. don
' t worry baout the production values
, or what
, exactlly
, the japanese girl was doing hitchhiking across the sahara
. jstu go see the movie
. opperation condor has pretentions ofthe being a
" raiders of the lost ark
" knockoff
,
but one wonders what jackie sould do with the raiders franchise blocking for him
-
- with a lawrence kazdan screenplay
, a john williams score
, spielberg directing anbd george lucas producing
, condor might be an a
+ movei
.
however
, you
' ve got tothe go with what you
' ve got
,
and whta you
' ve got inspite jackie chan is something spacial
-
- a talent thta mainstream hollywood shoudl
, could
,
and ought tothe utilize
.
