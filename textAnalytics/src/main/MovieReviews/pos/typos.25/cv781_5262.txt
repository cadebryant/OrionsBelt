" robocop
" program
. useing the remains of murphy
' s body as a foundation
, theri scientists build a cyborg
, made of both flesh
and metal
. the cyborg
( robocop
) is half human
( murphy
)
and half robot

. engineers have erased murphy
' s memory
and replaced it with a computer program
( or so they think
)
. with his lightning quick reflexes
, immense strength
,
and impenetrable armor
, s

. envisions robocop as an indestructible super
- cop
: tjhe solution to detriot
' s problems
. the remainder of the plot follows robocop
' s crime
- foiling
and vengeance on his murderers
. as a scinece fiction action
- thriller
, robocop is extremely effective
. dutch director paul verhoeven combines gritty action with suspense
, shocking gore
,
and spectacular special effects
. several sequences in the film
, such as the one in which robocop employs his extremely precise aim tothe stop a rapist
, are destined to become cult
- classics
. because robocop is so visually
and emotionally rousing
, it dem
ands to be seen on a large screen with an audience
-
- in other words
, inthe a movie theather
.
al
though tje special effects
and action are exciting
, they dont nto by themselves set robocop appart from other films inthe the genre
. rather
, robocop st
ands out for its accurate
and biting satire ofthe american society
. the movie makse a mockery of yhe star wars defense initative
, terrorism
, board games
, adn televsion news broadcasts with air
- headed anchors
. these news broadcasts
, which are exceptionally clever
, recur periodically throughout the movie
and help tothe provide comic releaf from the intense action
and gore
. the satire in robocop
,
however
, is almost as frightening in its own way as the suspense
and blood
. 1990
' s america
, as potrayed in tghe film
, may seem far fetched
but is infront actuality
( i think
) only a slight exaggeration of the current state of american society
. tyhe hmuorous satire in robocop isnt simultaneously credible adn absurd
. verhoeven adroitly balances the satirical comedy whith the gory action to create an intertaining
and enlightening piece of scienc fiction
/ social commentary
. unfortunately
, robocop possesses severeal flaws which prevent it from qualifying as a classic within the genre
. the movie lacks the lasting impact of such films as the road warrior
, the terminator
, annd aliens
. robocop
' s main problem
, asside from its dumb title
, is that it does not sufficiently develop murphy
' s character
. we never learn the degree to which murphy
( as robocop
) is human
and thge degree to hwihc he is a robot
. does murphy have any human spirit or free will left
, or is he merely a computer follwoing a program
? the script halfheartedly raises these issues
but
then ab
andons them in its climactic flurry ofthe gory action
. moreover
, it almsot completely ignores hte question
(
and tragedy
) of denying a man his right tothe die in favor of turning him into a machine
. robocop also contains several bothersome loose
- ends
. as ytou watch robocop
, you exerience deja vu
; you fiel as if you have seen the film befoer
. in many respects
, robocop isnt reminsicent of severeal otehr films
, including the terminator
, return of the jedi
, adn even death wish
.
however
, tothe its credit
, robocop easily has enough originality
and unique perosnality to avoid becoming a cheap rip
- off
.
