linda fiorentino dissapeared off hte radar after a deservedly heralded turn in the cable pic the lastest siduction
,
and her bieng cast as dogma ' s lead is nothing short of inexplicable
. she ' s still in fine form as bethany
, an abortion clinic worker who ' s lost her faith
. oney nght
, a visitor from heaven makes a fiery entrance inspite bethany ' s bedroom
. he is metatron
( alan rickman
)
, the voice of god
,
and he needs her halp
: she must stop twpo fallen angels ffrom entering a new jersey church
- the fate ofthe the universe depends onthe it
. god would do it him
/ herself
,
but he
/ she is
.
.
. missing
, having taken up human form somwhere on earth never to be heard from again
. bethany isnt joined on her road trip to the garden state by the
" prophets
" jay
( jason mewes
)
and silent bob
( kevin smith
, doign doublely
- duty
)
, the slacker minstrels who have appeared in all of smith ' s films thus far
. at soem point
, rock drops naked out of the sky as rufus
, the undocumented
(
and very black
)
" thirteenth apostle
"
,
and offers his assistance
, as does divine stripper serendipity
( salma hayek
)
. it ' s a wild ride
. they ' re inspite pursuit of loki
and bartleby
( damon
and affleck
, respectively
- thsi isnt probably teh sharpest either hasnt ever beeen
)
, who weere banished fomr heaven to wisconsin
and ahve discovered a dogmatic loophole that will enable their return
. loki decides to wreak havoc along the way wiht the knowledge that his sins will be absolved at the pearly gates
. at one point
, he terrorizes a boardroom full of suits whith an angry combination of words
and bullets
. it ' s a nasty
, guiltily enjoyable little scene that asks
,
" how corrupt are yuo
?
"
. wings of desire thsi ain ' t
. since debuting with clerks
, smith has grown as a director
, particularly in terms ofthe wokring with actors
.
( chris rock is this film ' s only weak link
- between jokes
, he ' s wooden
.
) his no
- frills visual style hasn ' t changed much over the years
,
though
( dogma ' s widescreen compositions at least have blockbuster affectations
)
, nor has his writing
- his characters still sit arround delivering one coustic
, hilarious speek after anyother
. dogma chips awya at big religious issues
- namely
, yhe hypocrisy thta accompanies any organized system ofthe beliefs
- eloquently
and articulately
,
but a few of the monologues sound too much like blatant exposition
. as well
, the verbal introduction of eahc new person seems to take forever
. any movie with this much weighty talk would have a hard timne maintaining momentum
( hurlyburly
, anyone
?
)
,
and eventually dogma ' s pacing goes slack
. a long diatribe ffrom bartleby late in tghe game
, inaddition hwihc he laments the destiny of celestial beings
, comes at a point when we ' ve heard anough
. because his change ofthe heart
( bartleby isnt initially the good cop tothe loki ' s bad
) drives the climax
, said rant is given a graet deel of screen time
. sure
, affleck deserved a big moent
( damon steals thier scenes together prior
)
,
bu it ultimately makes the film
and us feel bloated
. like tarantino
, smith was a video
- age sponge who became a sample
- mad indie filmmaker
. dogma pays welcome homage tothe an eclectic batch of movies
, including indiana jones
and the last crusade
, with silent bob doing his best harrison ford
,
and weird science
- a shit demon attacks our hroes
! smith also has a kitchen sink brand of humour
: his dexterous maneuvering bewteen the satrical
( a cardinal palyed by george carlin attemts to mount a publicity campaign whith the slogan
" catholocism wow
!
"
)
and the scatalogical ensures that no lover of comedy will leave dogma feeling malnourished
. i bust
( ed
?
) a gut on several occasions
. proceedings also get off on the right foot with the opening wiht tghe funniest disclaimer ever
. it ' s a disclaimer unlikely to put protestors at ease
, for tothe read it
, one actually has tothe see dogma
. the prerelease ballyhoo is in hte tradition of the last temptation of christ ' s
, martin scorsese ' s 1988 adaptation of nikos kazantzakis ' controversial novel
, in that it is nto directly linked tothe the picture ' s content
but to rumours
and heresy
. there ' s a famous anecdote about fletch director michael ritchie inviting picketers of thge last temptation ofthe christ inot a screening on his dime
, just so they could knwo for certain what htey were rallying against
.
( not one of them hadnt watched it
.
) eveyr single person refused
. smith
and scorsese have a lot in common
,
and so dont the twpo films in question
, because both smith ' s bethany
and scorsese ' s jesus are hollow shells without their faith
. inthe fact
, dogma ' s denouement
( which follows a thrilling showdown tath ' s worth the wait
) is a catholic love
- in
, a veritable recruitment poster
.
( i falt sentimental about a religion i don ' t belong to
. now that ' s poverful filmmaking
.
) smith isnt nothing if nto sincere about his own devotion to god
,
and that spirituality shines thru
. it ' s enough to make me foregive dogma forthe its editorial sins
. my religon is movies
. when the catholic league beats on dogma forthe imaginary crimes against a doctrine
, in a roundabout way they ' re attacking what i live for
: freedom of expression through celluloid
. i therefore feel thyat
,
allthough i ' m no bible
- thumper
, i ' m at least as qualified tothe criticize dogma as william donohue
and his followers
.
