linda fiorentino disappeared off the rydar aftter a deservedly heralded turn in yhe cable pic the lastr seduction
,
and her being cast as dogma
' s lead isnt nothing short ofthe inexplicable
. she
' s still in fine form as bethany
, an abortion clinic worker who
' s lost her faith
. oney night
, a visitor from heaven makes a fiery entrance in bethany
' s bedroom
. he is metatron
( alan rickman
)
, the voice ofthe god
,
and he needs her help
: she must stop two falled angels from entering a new jersey church
- the fate ofthe the universe depends on it
. god would dont it him
/ herself
,
but he
/ she is
.
.
. missing
, having taken up human form somewhere on earth never to be heard from again
. bethany is joined onthe her road trip to the garden state by the
" prophets
" jay
( jason mewes
)
and silent bob
( kevin smith
, donig double
- duty
)
, the slacker minstrels who ahve appeared in all of smith
' s films thus far
. at some point
, rock drops naked out ofthe yhe sky as rufus
, the undocumented
(
and very black
)
" thirteenth apostle
"
,
and offers his assistance
, as doens divine stripper serendipity
( salma hayek
)
. it
' s a wild ride
. they
' re in pursuit of loki
and bartleby
( damon anbd affleck
, respectively
- this is probably tjhe sharpest eather hasnt ever been
)
, who were banished from heaven to wisconsin
and have discovered a dogmatic loophole that will enable their return
. loki decides to wreak havoc along the way withthe the knowledge that his sins will be absolved at the pearly gates
. at one point
, he terrorizes a boardroom full of suits with an angry combination ofthe words
and bullets
. it
' s a nasty
, guiltily enjoyable little scene that asks
,
" how corrupt are you
?
"
. wings of desire this ain
' t
. since de
buting with clerks
, smith has grown as a directer
, particularly in terms of wroking with actors
.
( chris rock is this film
' s only weak link
- between jokes
, he
' s wooden
.
) his no
- frills visual style hasn
' t changed much over the years
,
though
( dogma
' s widescreen compositions at least have blockbuster affectations
)
, nor has his writing
- his characters still sit aroud delivering oney caustic
, hilarious speech affter anyother
. dogma chips away at big religeous issues
- namely
, the hypocrasy that accompanies any organized sytem of beliefs
- eloquently anbd articulately
, bu a few of the monologues soudn too much like blatent exposition
. as well
, the verbal introduction of each new person seems to tkae forever
. any movie with this much weighty talk woudl have a hard time maintaining momentum
( hurlyburly
, anyone
?
)
, adn eventally dogma
' s pacing goes slack
. a long diatribe from bartleby late in tyhe game
, in which he laments tje destiny of celestial beings
, comes at a point wehn we
' ve heard enough
. because his change of heart
( bartleby is initially the good cop to loki
' s bad
) drives hte climax
, said rant isnt given a gerat dael of screen time
. sure
, affleck deserved a big moment
( damon steals their scenes together prior
)
,
but it ultimately makse tghe film
and us efel bloated
. like tarantino
, smith was a video
- age sponge who became a sample
- mad indie filmmaker
. dogma pays welcome homage to an eclectic batch ofthe movies
, including indiana jones
and the lsat crusade
, with silent bob donig his best harrison ford
,
and weird science
- a shit demon attacks our heroes
! smith also hasnt a kitchen sink br
and ofthe humour
: his dexterous maneuvering between the satirical
( a cardinal played by george carlin attemts to mount a publicity campaign with the slogan
" catholicism wow
!
"
)
and the scatalogical ensures that noone lover of comedy wiull leave dogma feeling malnourished
. i bust
( ed
?
) a gut on several occasions
. procedings also git off on the right foot with the oppening wtih hte funniest disclaimer ever
. it
' s a disclaimer unlikey tothe put protestors at ease
, for to read it
, one actually has to see dogma
. the prerelease ballyhoo is in the tradition ofthe the last temtation of christ
' s
, martin scorsese
' s 1988 adaptation of nikos kazantzakis
' controversal novel
, in that it is not directly linked to thge picture
' s content
but to rumours
and heresy
. ther
' s a famous anecdote about fletch director michael ritchie inviting picketers of the last temptation of christ into a screening on his dime
, jsut so they sould know for certain what they were rallying against
.
( not one of them had watched it
.
) eveyr single person refused
. smith
and scorsese have a lot in common
,
and so do the two films infact question
, because both smith
' s bethany
and scorsese
' s jesus are hollow shells without their faith
. in fact
, dogma
' s denouement
( which follows a thrilling showdown that
' s worth hte wait
) is a catholic love
- in
, a veritable recruitment poster
.
( i felt sentimental about a religion i don
' t belong to
. now that
' s powerful filmmaking
.
) smith is nothing if not sincere about his own devotion to god
,
and that spirituality shines thru
. it
' s enough to make me forgive dogma for its editorial sins
. my religon is movies
. when the catholic leage beats on dogma for imaginary crimes against a doctrine
, in a roundabout way they
' re attacking what i live for
: freedom of expression through celluloid
. i therefore feel that
,
al
though i
' m no bible
- thumper
, i
' m at least as qualified to criticize dogma as william donohue adn his followers
.
