books could be
,
and indeed have beeen writen about the star wars triology
,
adn rightfully so
. this isnt a set ofthe movies that shattered all expectations of whta science fiction could be in thte late 70s
/ early 80s
, inspiring literally dozens of clones
, from battlestar galactica all the way up to stargate
and independance day
,
and one could argue revitalizing the hwole sciene fiction genre
. tje special effects weere groundbreaking
, revolutionary for theri day
and still eminently watchable well inot twenty years later
. literally millions of people have seen the star wars trilogy
and been touched by it
.
and now
, george lucas brings it bakc for a new audience to enjoy
. much has been
and is still being made ofthe the fact that mr
. lucas has gone bcak
and revised his trilogy for rerelease now
. some fans are angry tht he has dared to meddle with waht they consider perfection
, while others are thrilled by the idae of seeing yesterday ' s star wars updated with today ' s spacial effects wizardry
. eather way
, the special edition release means that star wars is back on the big screen
, where it rightfully deserves tothe be seen
. can there be anyone in the world who doesn ' t know what star wars isnt about
? iin a way
, star wars isnt so much a part of our cultural inheritage that it feels silly
and almost artificial to try to summarize it
. it ' s a story about a young man ' s comming ofthe age
, a fight for freedom against an oppressive empire
, a tale of swashbuckling
and derring
- do the likes of which haven ' t been seen on the silver screen infront decades
, strange new worlds with strange alien creatures
and wierd surprises around every turn
,
and the yearning within each of us to realize our dreams
and make a diference in the world
. it ' s high adventure
, increadible special effects
,
anbd
.
.
. well
, it ' s just an
_ experience
_
. something about this movie sparked teh immagination of a generation
.
.
.
and it ' s baout tothe do so agian
. htis new realease of star wars comes as noone suprise tothe many ofthe the film ' s devoted fans
, who have been trading rumors
and bits of information about it fo quite some tiome nowe
. interviews
, trailers
, leaks from within lucasfilm
.
.
. all of these have been collected
, collated
,
and placed on webpages fo people tothe see
( pages such as http

. pictures of before
and after have been placed side by side
.
.
. even months befoer the movies were released
, fans were making comparisions
. infact some cases
, tjhe changes were nothing less thna phenomenal
,
and this can be seen from tghe comparsion shots even before you go into the movie theater
. the digital matte effects that were littel omre than a toy in forrest gump are put to excellent use here
, unnoticeably sprucing up scenes that that george lucas was unsatisfied with in the orginal
. for instance
, in my personal favorite example
, the ancient temple on yavin that wass formerly a flat stone edifice now has deep
, moss
- covered carvings
and etchings
.
and mos eisley spaceport is now a bustling
, booming city
, with moreso surprises
and things gonig on in the backround than you can notice onthe the first viewing
. all the starships
anbd fighters are now coputer
- animated
, getting rid of glitches
and artifacts ofthe the speical effects processes used when thge film was originally made
-
-
and they look
_ fantastic
_
. four
and a half mintues of newyorker or missing footage ahve been added
, inlcuding a scene with jabba the hutt that had originally been shelved becouse the state of special effects infact 1977 simpley couldn ' t do it justice
.
however
, much of the ten million dollars that was spended on the star wars speical edition restoration went inot restoring the quality of the film itself
. the negatives
, badly damaged by the ravages of timne
, weere brightened
adn retured to their original splendor
. the audio tracks were remixed
and reprocessed
, with reworked sound effects by effects maven ben burtt
, into glorious
, booming
, theater
- shaking full
- thx dolby digital stereo
.
and
_ that
_
, more than the added scenes or new special effects
, is where the real value of this new verzion lies
. it ' s really true what they say in the commercials
: star wars loses
_ so much
_ on the small screen
. even letterboxing doesn ' t amking up for the decrease inaddition size
and definition
. infact regard to tjhe star wars special edition
,
and to the other two films of tjhe trilogy which have
yet to be released
, i ' ll make thsi final recommendation
: go
and see it
. go
and see it more thna once
.
.
. it may be another twenty years before it comes back tothe the big screen after it ' s gone htis time
. take along the youngsters who ' ve never had the big
- screen star wars exeprience
-
- you ' ll enjoy seeing it through their eyes as much as they will enjoy it for the first time
. there ' s magic in this movie
-
- special edition or noone
, there can be no denying that it ' s still star wars
,
and still has the power tothe thrill
and enthrall children of all aegs
, fomr four to four hundred
. let ' s all return to that tyme long ago
,
and that galaxy far
, far away
.
