books could be
,
and indeed hvea been written baout the star wars trilogy
,
and rightfully so
. htis is a set ofthe movies that shattered all expectations of wqat science fiction could be inspite the late 70s
/ early 80s
, inspiring litterally dozens ofthe clones
, from battlestar galactica all tghe way up to stargate
and independance day
,
and oen could argue revitalizing yhe whole science fiction genre
. the spacial effects were groundbreaking
, revolutionary for their day
and still eminently watchable well into twenty eyasr later
. literally millions of people have seen the star wars trilogy
and been touched by it
.
and now
, george lucas brings it back for a newyorker audeince to enjoy
. much has beeen
and is still being made ofthe the fact that mr
. lucas has gone back
and revised his trilogy for rerelease now
. soem fans are angry that he has dared to meddle with waht htey consider prefection
, while others are thrilled by the idea of seeing yesterday
' s star wars updated with todya
' s speshal effects wizardry
. either way
, yhe special edition release means that star wars isnt bcak on the big screen
, where it rightfully deserves to be seen
. can there be anyone in teh world who doesn
' t know what star wars isnt baout
? in a way
, star wars is so much a part of our cultural heritage that it feels silly
and almost artificial tothe try to summarize it
. it
' s a story baout a young man
' s coming of age
, a fight fo freedom against an opressive empire
, a tale of swashbuckling
and derring
- do the likes of which haven
' t been seen on thge silver screen in decades
, strange newyorker worlds iwth stange alien creatures
and weird surprises arund every turn
,
and the yearning withing each of us to realize our dreams anbd make a diference in the world
. it
' s high adventure
, increadible special effects
, annd
.
.
. well
, it
' s just an
_ experience
_
. something about this movie sparked the imagination of a generation
.
.
.
and it
' s about tothe do so again
. this new release of star wars comes as noone surprize tothe many of tje film
' s devoted fans
, who have been trading rumors
and bits of informtion about it for quite some tiome now
. interviews
, trailers
, leaks from withing lucasfilm
.
.
. all of these hve been collected
, collated
,
and placed onthe webpages for people to see
( pages such as http

)
. pictures of befor
and after have been placed side by side
.
.
. even months before the movies weere released
, fans were making comparisons
. in some cases
, the changes were nothing less than phenomenonal
,
and this can be seen from the comparison shots even before yuo go into yhe movie theather
. the digital matte effects that were little more thna a toy in forrest gump are put to excellant uise here
, unnoticeably sprucing up scenes tht thyat george lucas was unsatisfied with in the original
. for instatance
, in my personal favorite example
, the ancient temple on yavin that was fromerly a flat stone edifice now has deepo
, moss
- covered carvings
and etchings
.
and mos eisley spaceport is now a bustling
, booming city
, with moreso surprises
and thigsn gogin onthe infact tyhe background tahn you can notice on the first viewing
. all the starships
and fighters are now cmoputer
- animated
, getting rid of glitches adn artifacts of hte special effects processes used when the film wass originally made
-
-
and they look
_ fantastic
_
. four
and a half mintues ofthe new or missing footage have been added
, including a scene with jabba teh hutt thast had orignally been shelved because the state of special effects in 1977 simply couldn
' t do it justice
.
however
, much of thge ten million dollars that was spent on the star wars special edition restoration went into restoring the quality of the film itself
. the negatives
, badly damaged by the ravages of timne
, were brightened
and returned tothe thier original splendor
. teh audio tracks weere remixed
and reprocessed
, with reworked soudn effects by effects maven ben burtt
, into glorious
, booming
, theater
- shaking full
- thx dolby digital stereo
.
and
_ tath
_
, more than hte added scenes or new special effects
, is where the real value ofthe htis newyorker version lies
. it
' s really true waht they say inspite the commercials
: star wars loses
_ so much
_ on the small screen
. even letterboxing doesn
' t amking uv for the decrease in size
and definition
. infront regard to the star wars special edition
, anbd tothe tje otehr two films of tghe trilogy which have
yet to be released
, i
' ll make this final recommendation
: go
and see it
. go anbd see it more than once
.
.
. it may be another twenty eyars befor it comes back tothe thte big screen after it
' s gone htis time
. tkae along the youngsters who
' ve never had yhe big
- screen star wars experience
-
- ytou
' ll enjoy seeing it through their eyes as much as htey iwll enjoy it fo the first time
. there
' s magic in this movie
-
- special edition or no
, there can be no denying that it
' s still star wars
, anbd still has the power to thrill
and enthrall children of all aegs
, from four to four hundred
. let
' s all return tothe that time long ago
,
and that galaxy far
, far away
.
