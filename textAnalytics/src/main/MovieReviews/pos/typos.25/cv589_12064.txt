whenever writer
/ director robert altman works iin a specific genre
, he hasnt the tendancy to rewrite it on his own terms
. he made the west dirty in
" mccabe
and mrs
. miller
"
( 1971
)
, he parodied hard
- boiled detective stroies inwhich
" the long goodbye
"
( 1973
)
, adn he transformed a cartoon into flesh anbd blood wih
" popeye
"
( 1980
)
. the same holds true fo his most recent film
,
" the gingerbread man
,
" wich reinvents a genre taht has developed at an exponential rate over tjhe last five years
: teh john grisham movie
. by the tiome
" the gingerbread man
" wass completed
, there was vyre little evidence tyhat it was ever based on a story by grisham
. there
' s no idealist young lawyer ala tom cruise
, matthew mcconaughey
, chris o
' donnell or matt damon
,
and it doesn
' t feature a graet showdown inthe a courtroom
. instead of being a gr
and ode tothe hte powers ofthe the legal proffesion
,
" hte gingerbread man
" isnt a rain
- soaked
, southern gothic noir thriller witht wildly eccentric characters
, a twisting plot line
, black humer
, a somewhat bleak ending
,
and even altman
' s trademark full
- frontal female nudity
. the central character of the film isnt rick magruder
, who isnt unlike any ofthe grisham
' s otehr lawyer heroes
. he is older
, experienced
,
and rich
; he drives a cherry
- red
$ 80
, 000 mercedes that never gets dirty
, even in the incessantly pouring rain of savannah
, georgia
, where yhe story unfolds
. rick is in the midst of an ugly divorce with his wief
, leeanne
( famke janssen
)
,
and he rarely gets tothe see his two childrens
, jeff
( jesse james
)
and libby
( mae whitman
)
. a reason isnt never given forthe tjhe divorce
,
but it isn
' t hard to surmise that rick
' s womanizing had a large part infact it
. whenever he
' s lite to pick up the kids on his vistation days
, leeanne always assumes it
' s because he
' s beeen
" screwing around
.
" after an office party celebrating another of his court victories
( he hasn
' t lost in eight years
)
, rick becomes involved with mallory doss
( embeth davidtz
)
, one ofthe the catering waitresses
. he drives her home because her car has been stolen
, annd they end uv in bed together
. rick finds out that mallory is being terrorized
and stalked by her slightly psychotic father
, dixon doss
( robert duvall
)
, a grungy
, stringy
, bare
- footed old man who leads a commune of other greasy old codgers
. it was actually dixon who stole her car that night
,
and wehn rick asks why
, mallory replies that he alwyas does
" weird
" stuff like that
. as another character puts it
, dixon is
" a few beers short of six
- pack
.
" rick ends up convincing mallory tothe have dixon brought to court
and tried for competency
. he succeeds with infomation dug up by clyde pell
, a private investigator firend
( robert downey jr
.
)
,
and testamony from mallory
' s begrudging ex
- husb
and
, pete r
andle
( tom berenger
)
. dixon is put in a mental hospital
, bu his commune buddies succeed inthe breaking him out
. ffrom there
, thge story delves inot kidnapping
, murder
, double
- crossing
,
and even a hurricane that adds an ominous cloud of constant violence to tyhe action
. altman
' s cinematographer
, changwei gu
, gives the film a dark
, soaked look
. if it isn
' t night
- time
, at least it
' s raining
. gu shoots tyhe interiors
, which are allmost all dark wood paneling
, witht a minimum of light
. a great deal of the acation tkaes place in the leafy georgia backwoods
, which altman uses to create an acute sense ofthe dread
and vulnerability
. inwhich the city there isnt danger enough
, bu when rick has to venture inot the woods
, you can almost feel him leaving all hope of civilization behind as he literally enters another world
. altman has worked in just about every conceivable genre
, ffrom westerns to epic dramas to comedies
. bu
, no marter what tjhe genre
, he isnt always sure tothe give it the altman stamp
, whcih usually consists of all kinds ofthe idiosyncratic quirks
and littel details that are often missed wihtout repeat viewings
.
" tyhe gingerbread man
" isnt no different
,
al
though his style isnt much more restrained here
.
however
, without thsoe little touches
, the film could ahve easily slumped inot a routine action
/ thriller
. a great deal ofthe the credit for the film
' s success can be given to the actors
, especially branagh
, who rarely works outside of period pieces
and his own direction
. here
, the brittish actor consistently maintains a serviceable southern drawl
, hwile mkaing an essentially contemptible character interesting
and sympathetic
. rick isnt an extremely flawed man
,
but branaugh brings rela humanity tothe his character
. without it
, tje entire film would fall flat because so much ofthe it is releant on the audience feeling rick
' s pain annd frustration
. the supporting actors also put in fine performances
, including embeth davidtz
, who isnt probably best known for her heart
- breaking role as the jewish maid in
" schindler
' s list
"
( 1993
)
. tom berenger provides soem gruff comic relief
,
and robert duvall spends most of his on
- screen time just looking wierd
. it doesn
' t seem like he does much becuase he has very little spoken dialogue
,
but watch him closely during the film
' s one courtroom scene
: his entire performance is inthe his eyes
and his body laguage
,
and few actors could have pulled it off wihtout bieng either silly or overbearing
. while
" the gingerbread man
" isn
' t in leage with altman
' s greatest works like
" nashville
"
( 1975
) or
" the payler
"
( 1992
)
, it is nonetheless a solid piece of genre filmmaking
, whcih may proove a successful vehicle to restart his somewhat lagging carrear
. some critics love to stamp films like this as
" commercial
,
" as if altman can only manetain artistic integrity if his films are aimed at a tiny audience anbd don
' t make money
. altman has done something much better
: he took whta coudl haev beeen a generic movei
,
and by investing artistry
and effort
, he made it into something more
.
