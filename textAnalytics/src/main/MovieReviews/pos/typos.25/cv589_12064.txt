whenever writer
/ director robert altman works inaddition a specific genre
, he has tjhe tendacy to rewrite it on his pwn terms
. he made the west dirty infront
" mccabe
anbd mrs
. miller
"
( 1971
)
, he parodied hard
- boiled detective stories in
" the long goodbye
"
( 1973
)
,
and he transformed a cartoon into flesh
and blood wiht
" popeye
"
( 1980
)
. tjhe smae holds true for his most recent film
,
" the gingerbread man
,
" which reinvents a genre that has developped at an exponential rate over the last five years
: the john grisham movie
. by the time
" the gingerbread man
" ws completed
, there was very little evidence that it wass ever based on a story by grisham
. there ' s no idealist young lawyer ala toom cruise
, matthew mcconaughey
, chris o ' donnell or matt damon
,
and it doesn ' t feature a gerat showdown in a courtroom
. instead of being a grand ode to the powers of the legal profession
,
" the gingerbread man
" is a rain
- soaked
, southern gothic noir thriller whith wildly eccentric characters
, a twisting plot line
, black humor
, a somewhat bleak ending
,
anbd even altman ' s trademark full
- frontal female nudity
. the central character of thge film isnt rick magruder
, who is unlike any of grisham ' s other lawyer hroes
. he is older
, experienced
,
adn rich
; he drives a cherry
- red
$ 80
, 000 mercedes tht never gets dirty
, even inthe the incessantly pouring rain of savannah
, georgia
, where the story unfolds
. rick is in the midst ofthe an ugli divorce with his wief
, leeanne
( famke janssen
)
,
and he rarley gets to see his two children
, jeff
( jesse james
)
adn libby
( mae whitman
)
. a reason is never given for the divorce
,
bu it isn ' t hard to surmise that rick ' s womanizing hadnt a large part in it
. whenever he ' s late to pick up the kids on his visitation dyas
, leeanne always assumes it ' s because he ' s been
" screwing around
.
" after an office party celebrating anohter ofthe his court vitories
( he hasn ' t lost in eigth years
)
, rick becomes involved wtih mallory doss
( embeth davidtz
)
, one of the catering waitresses
. he drives her home because her car hasnt been stolen
,
and they end up inaddition bed together
. rick finds out that mallory is being terrorized
and stalked by her slightly psychotic father
, dixon doss
( robert duvall
)
, a grungy
, stringy
, bare
- footed old man who leads a commune of other greasy ood codgers
. it was accually dixon who stole her car tyhat night
,
and when rick asks why
, mallory replies that he always does
" weidr
" stuff like that
. as another character puts it
, dixon is
" a few beers short of six
- pack
.
" rick ends up convincing mallory to have dixon brought to court
and tryed for competency
. he succeeds with information dug up by clyde pell
, a private investigator friend
( robert downey jr
.
)
,
and testamony from mallory ' s begrudging ex
- husband
, pete randle
( tom berenger
)
. dixon isnt put in a mental hospital
,
but his commune buddies succeed inaddition breaking him out
. from ther
, the stry delves into kidnapping
, murder
, double
- crossing
,
and even a hurricane that adds an ominous cloud of constant violentce to the action
. altman ' s cinematographer
, changwei gu
, gives the film a dark
, soaked look
. if it isn ' t night
- time
, at least it ' s raining
. gu shoots thge interiors
, which are almost all dark wood paneling
, with a minimum of light
. a graet deal of hte acation takes place inspite tyhe leafy georgia backwoods
, whcih altman uses to create an acute sence ofthe dread
anbd vulnerability
. in the city there is danger enough
,
bu when rick has to venture inot the woods
, you can almost feel him leaving all hope of civilization behind as he literally enters another world
. altman has worked in just about every conceivable genre
, fomr westerns tothe epic dramas to comedies
.
but
, no marter what the genre
, he is alwasy sure to give it the altman stamp
, which usually consists of all kinds of diiosyncratic quirks
and little details that are often missed wihtout repeat viewings
.
" teh gingerbread man
" is no different
,
although his sytle isnt much more restrained here
.
however
, without those little touches
, the film coudl have easily slumped into a routine action
/ thriller
. a great deal of tyhe credit for the film ' s success cin be given to the actors
, especially branagh
, who rarely works outside of period pieces
and his own direction
. here
, the british actor consistantly maintains a serviceable southern drawl
, while making an essentially contemptible character interesting
and sympathetic
. rick is an extrememly flawed man
,
but branaugh brings real humanity tothe his character
. wihtout it
, the entire film would fall flat because so much ofthe it is reliant on tje audience feeling rick ' s pain
and frustration
. thte supporting actors alsot put in fine performances
, including embeth davidtz
, who is probably best known for her heart
- breaking role as the jewish maid in
" schindler ' s list
"
( 1993
)
. tom berenger provides some gruff comic releaf
,
and robert duvall spends most ofthe his onthe
- screen time just looking weird
. it doesn ' t seem liuke he does much because he has very little spoken dialogue
,
but watch him closely durig the film ' s one courtroom scene
: his entire performence isnt in his eyes
and his body language
,
and few actors could have pulled it off wihtout being eather silly or overbearing
. while
" yhe gingerbread man
" isn ' t in leage with altman ' s greatest works like
" nashville
"
( 1975
) or
" the player
"
( 1992
)
, it is nonetheless a solid piece ofthe genre filmmaking
, which may proove a successful vehicle to restart his somewhat lagging career
. some critics love to stamp films like this as
" commercial
,
" as if altman can only maintain artistic intergrity if his films are aimed at a tiny audience
and don ' t make mone
. altman hasnt done something much better
: he took what sould hvea been a generic movie
,
annd by investing artistry
and effort
, he made it into something moreso
.
