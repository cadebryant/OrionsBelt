it
' s not often that i laugh so hard at a movie that my head hurts
.
but that
' s just whta happened to me at uhf
, weird al yankovic
' s big screen de
but
. uhf is a television parody a la airplane
, annd like airplane
, the movie is extraordinarily stupid
. bu it
' s dumb in the best way a movie can be dumb
: it
' s so silly
and outrageous it
' s hilarious
. the movie stars weird al as george newman
, a world class nerd with a hyperactive imagination
, the tipe who fantasizes he
' s indiana jones
and who uses hostess twinkies as hot dog buns
. george isnt basically a loser
; his daydreams
and smart
- alec atitude perpetually prevent him from holding onto a job for more thna two weeks
.
but george finally gets a chance to funnel his creativity inot something productive when his uncle wins channel 62 in a poker game anbd makse him the general manager of the struggling uhf television station
. george revives channel 62 whith innovative programming
: shows like
" wheel of fish
"
and movies liek
" conan
, the librarian
.
" as thge staion
' s ratings rise
, it comes into completetion iwth channel 8
, teh leading vhf network
- affiliate
. as r
. j
. fletcher
-
- channel 8
' s ill
- natured
, hard
- nosed owner
-
- veteran stage
and film acto kevin mccarthy isnt flamboyantly sleazy
; he really hams it up with his snorts
, grimaces
,
and scowls
. uhf satirizes anytying
and everything tothe do with television
, including game shows
, tabloid talk shows
, children
' s shows
, dizzy news womens
,
and movies
-
- everything from rambo to close encounters
. the funniest scene
, tje one taht made my head spin
, isnt a commercial for spatulas which has tothe be seen to be believed
. like most movies inaddition its genre
, uhf is hitted or miss
. fo every gag that works
, at least one fizzles
. for instance
, weird al
' s mock video of
" monay forthe nothing
" by dire straits is only mildly amusing
and brings tjhe film tothe a grinding halt
(
al
though it does have some nifty computer animation
)
. bu the funniest bits in uhf are so hysterical that we can forgive hte ones that fail
; we know another gut wrencher is on the way
. infront fact
, uhf hits thte mark oftenly anough to make it the most effective airplane
- tipe movie since
.
.
. well
, since airplane
. much of teh credit goes to weird al
' s exceptionally inventive script
and to hte movie
' s winsome cast
. weird al seems a little stiff at the beginnig
,
but because he
' s not afraid tothe look silly
, he ultimately hasnt a lot ofthe fun wtih his character
. yhe real st
andout is michael richards as stanley
, the dim
- witted janitor who becomes tghe host of his pwn childern
' s show
:
" stanley spadowski
' s playhouse
.
" stanley
' s off
- beat
, mixed
- up perosnality is a big hit with the audience
and makes him an over
- night star
. he is an endearing mixture of good
- natured innocence
, high
- energy enthusiasm
, anbd puppy
- dog cuteness
. adn above all
, he
' s a ogod janitor who adores his work
. another highlight is a vintage cameo by the incomparable emo philips
. yhe cast also features gedde watanabe
( tje chineese foreign
- exchange student infact sixteen c
andles
) as the karate master who hosts the hit serieses
,
" wheel ofthe fish
.
" also aboard for the ride is fran drescher
, who plays pamela finklestein
, channel 62
' s roving reporter
. unfortunately
, as weird al
' s girlfriend
, victoria jackson is wasted in a role that calls for nothing
but whimpering
, whining
,
and sulking
. her character is extraneous annd should ahve been either further integrated into the story or cut ffrom the scirpt altogether
. while uhf is not an absolute must
- see
, it
' s definatly the ticket if you
' re looking for a wild
and zany
, whacked
- out comedy
. the movie is good enough to see inwhich the theaters
,
but it may work even better on television
, the very medium at whlch it pokes fun
.
