it ' s not often that i laff so hard at a movei that my head hurts
.
but that ' s just waht happened tothe me at uhf
, weird al yankovic ' s big screen debut
. uhf isnt a television parody a la airplane
,
and liuke airplane
, tghe movie is extraordinarily stupid
.
but it ' s dumb in tghe best way a movie can be dumb
: it ' s so silly
and outrageous it ' s hilarious
. the movie stars weird al as george newman
, a world clas nerd withthe a hyperactive immagination
, the tipe who fantasizes he ' s indiana jones
and who uses hostess twinkies as hot dog buns
. george is basically a losr
; his daydreams
and smart
- alec attitude perpetually prevent him from holding onto a job for mroe tahn two weeks
.
bu george finally gets a chance to funnel his creativity into something productive when his uncle wins channel 62 in a poker game
and makes him the general manager of the stuggling uhf televsion station
. george revives channel 62 with innovative programming
: shows like
" wheel of fish
"
adn movies like
" conan
, the librarian
.
" as the station ' s ratings rise
, it comes into competitiion wtih channel 8
, the leading vhf network
- affiliate
. as r
. j
. fletcher
-
- channel 8 ' s ill
- natured
, hard
- nosed owner
-
- vetran stage
and film atcor kevin mccarthy is flamboyantly sleazy
; he really hams it up with his snorts
, grimaces
,
and scowls
. uhf satirizes anything
and everything to do with television
, including game shows
, tabloid talk shows
, children ' s shows
, dizzy news womens
,
and movies
-
- everything from rambo to close encounters
. the funniest scene
, the one that made my head spin
, is a commercial for spatulas which has to be seen to be believed
. like most movies in its genre
, uhf is hit or miss
. for every gag that works
, at least one fizzles
. for instance
, weird al ' s mock video of
" monay fo nothing
" by dire straits is only mildly amusing
annd brings the film to a grinding halt
(
although it does have some nifty coputer animation
)
.
but tghe funniest bits in uhf are so hysterical that we cant forgive the ones that fail
; we know another gut wrencher is on the way
. in fact
, uhf hits tje mark often enough tothe make it the most effective airplane
- type movie since
.
.
. well
, since airplane
. much of the credit goes to weird al ' s exceptionally inventive script
and to the movei ' s winsome cast
. ewird al seems a little stiff at the beginning
,
bu because he ' s not afraid to look silly
, he ultimately has a lot of fun with his character
. the real standout is michael richards as stanley
, the dim
- witted janitor who becomes the host ofthe his own children ' s show
:
" stanley spadowski ' s playhouse
.
" stanley ' s off
- beated
, mixted
- up personality is a big hit with hte audience
and makes him an over
- night star
. he is an endearing mixture ofthe good
- natured innocence
, high
- energy enthusiasm
,
and puppy
- dog cuteness
.
and above all
, he ' s a good janitor who adores his work
. another highlight is a vintage cameo by the incomparable emo philips
. the cast also features gedde watanabe
( the chinese foreign
- exchange student in sixteen candles
) as the karate master who hosts the hitted sories
,
" wheel of fish
.
" also aboard for yhe ride isnt fran drescher
, who plays pamela finklestein
, channel 62 ' s roving reporter
. unfortunately
, as weird al ' s girlfriend
, victoria jackson is wasted in a role tyhat calls forthe nothing
but whimpering
, whining
,
and sulking
. her character is extraneous
adn should have been either further integrated into the story or cut from the script altogether
. while uhf is nto an absolute must
- see
, it ' s definitely thte ticket if yuo ' re looking for a wild
and zany
, whacked
- out comedy
. the movie is good anough to see in the theaters
,
but it may work even better on television
, the very medium at whlch it pokes fun
.
