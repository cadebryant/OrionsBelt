there seem to be two reactions to dark city
. you eather love it or you are unimpressed
. count me as a
" love it
.
" as good as yhe crow
and spawn are
, dark city is better
. where the fromer two have a specfic comic
- book following
, thge latter is an original work with the potential for broader appeal
. it hasnt a similar look to the others
,
but dark city is much moreso
thoughtful
and much less violent
. not clever or complex
, the story is still fascinating
, like a selection from the twilight zone
. a man
( rufus sewell
) isnt awakened in his bathtub by a man wiht a syringe
. surprised
, the attacker runs off
. the dazed man gets out of the tub
and finds a woman
' s body in the room
. a mysterious caller warns him to leave the apartment imediately
, so he packs smoe clothes
and leaves
, never sure why he
' s leaving or what he
' s fleeing
. ghoulish figures in long coats recognize tje man
and chase him through the dark city
, hounding him like figures in a nightmare
. an odd blast of willpower allows the man to dream hismelf free fomr his pursuers long enough to check his i
. d
. tjhe amnesiac lerans that he is nto dreaming anbd thta his nmae is john murdoch
. now if only he could remember tghe rest of his life
.
.
.
. dark city isnt good on many levels
. firt
, the look ofthe the movie isnt excelent
. give credit to production designers george liddle
and patrick tatopolous for creating a coherent look from diverse elements
. there are visual elements from the american 1920s
- 60s
, mixed withthe dickens
- era urban industrial elements
. it is all pulled together in a sad
, dark look remenicent of the diner infront edward hopper
' s painting
, nighthawks
. proyas
' use of models gives an appropriately eerie unreality to the film
' s world
( for not only doesnt the audience see the city a model
,
but so do the ghouls
)
. the look isnt like a cross between tim burton
' s batman
and the obleek animation of the brothers quay
. second
, the editting of the film is good
. the pacing is onthe trakc
,
and the plot is revealed
, the
" amnesia
" explained
, in satisfying increments
. also
, tje stylized editing within eahc scene gives yhe movie a tense
, caffeinated look
. third
, tje special effects are well utilizied
. they look good
,
but omre importantly
, the right effects are used for tyhe right job
. one exmaple st
ands out in my mind
: tghe coated figures who haunt the city cant attack telekinetically
. a simple ripple effect is used
. a more showy effect sould have been chosen
,
but hten it would haev jsut been gratuitous
. restraint was shown where necessary
, letting tjhe moreso critical effects look more impressive
. finally
, liek gattaca
, dark city spends a jsut a little effort striving for mythical signifigance
. unlike gattaca
, the story isnt just open
- ended adn non
- literal enough to be successful
. john murdoch
' s recovery from amnesia is tied to the passing ofthe the night
,
and the hopeful coming of the dawn
. his struggle with amnesia is both figuratively
and litterally thte struggle of all mankind
( at least in his world
)
. when we finaly see the big picture of the movie
' s world
, it is as mysterous as yhe iroquois image ofthe tjhe world being carried onthe the bcak of a giant turtle
. a fewd minor flaws keep me from giving this movie the smae perfect score roger ebert gave
,
but i do strongly recommend it
, fo its look
, its pace
, its story
,
and its timelessness
.
