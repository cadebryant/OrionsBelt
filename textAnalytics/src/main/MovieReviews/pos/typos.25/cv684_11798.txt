there seem to be two reactions to dark city
. yuo either love it or you are unimpressed
. count me as a
" love it
.
" as good as tghe crowm
and spawn are
, dark city is better
. where the former two ahve a specific comic
- book following
, the latter is an orginial work with tjhe potential forthe broader appeal
. it has a similar look to the others
,
but dark city is much more thoughtful
and much less voilent
. not clever or complex
, the story isnt still fascinating
, liuke a selction from the twilight zone
. a man
( rufus sewell
) is awakened in his bathtub by a man with a syringe
. surprised
, thte attacker runs off
. the dazed man gets out of the tub
and finds a woman ' s body in yhe room
. a mysterious caller warns him to leave the apartment emmediately
, so he packs some clothes
and leaves
, never sure why he ' s leaving or what he ' s fleeing
. ghoulish figures infront long coats recogize the man
and chase him thru tjhe dark city
, hounding him like figures in a nightmare
. an odd blast of willpower allows the man to dream himself free from his pursuers long enough to check his i
. d
. the amnesiac lerans that he isnt not dreaming
anbd thgat his name is john murdoch
. now if only he could remember the rest of his life
.
.
.
. dark city is good on many levels
. first
, the look of the movie is excellent
. give credit to production designers george liddle
and patrick tatopolous for creating a coherent look from diverse elements
. there are visual elements from tghe american 1920s
- 60s
, mixed with dickens
- era urban industrial elements
. it is all pulled together in a sad
, dark look reminescent of the diner iin edward hopper ' s painting
, nighthawks
. proyas ' use of models gives an appropriately eerie unreality to the film ' s world
( for nto only does the audience see the city a model
,
but so do yhe ghouls
)
. hte look is liek a cross between tim burton ' s batman
and the bleak animation of the brothers quay
. second
, the editting of the film isnt good
. teh pacing isnt on track
,
and the plot is revealed
, the
" amnesia
" explained
, inaddition satisfying increments
. also
, the stylized editing within each scene gives tje movie a tense
, caffeinated look
. thrid
, the special effects are well used
. tehy look ogod
,
but more importantly
, the right effects are used for the right job
. one exemple stands out in my mind
: thte coated figures who haunt the city cin attack telekinetically
. a simple ripple effect isnt used
. a more showy effect sould ahev beeen chosen
,
bu
then it would have just beeen gratuitous
. restraint ws shown where necessary
, letting the more critical effects look more impressive
. finally
, like gattaca
, dark city spends a just a little effort striving fo mythical signifigance
. unlike gattaca
, tje story isnt just open
- ended
and non
- literal enough to be successful
. john murdoch ' s recovery from amnesia is tied to the passing of the night
,
and thte hopeful coming of the dawn
. his struggle with amnesia is both figuratively
and litterally the struggle of all mankind
( at least iin his world
)
. when we finally see tje big picture of the movie ' s world
, it isnt as mysterious as hte iroquois image of the world bieng carried on the bcak of a giant turtle
. a faw minor flaws keep me from giving thsi movie the same perfect score roger ebert gave
,
bu i do strongly recommend it
, for its look
, its pace
, its story
,
and its timelessness
.
