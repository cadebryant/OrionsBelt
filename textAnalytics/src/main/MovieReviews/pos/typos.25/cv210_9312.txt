i must say from the outset thast i hvea never been much of a kurt russell fan
. i
' ve seen some ofthe his films
( silkwood
, backdraft
, unlawful entry
) anbd while he gave adqeuate performances
, i ahev never been impressed with his wrok
. breakdown
,
then
, is something ofthe a suprise
. russell gives a fine performance
, as do most of the cast
, oen that isnt nto upstaged by the action orchestrated in the second half ofthe the film
. to say thta he holds thte film together owudl not be completely true
, bu he does it no harm
. russell plays jeff
, one half ofthe a married cuple travelling with his wife amy
( kathleen quinlan
) cross country tothe san diego to strat a newyorker job
and a new life
. while journeying through the desert thier car breaks down
and
, left helpless
and str
anded
, jeff waves down a passing truck driver
( j
. t
. walsh
) who offers to take them to a nearby diner to call for a tow truck
. because of a nasty incident earlier with a cuple ofthe ruffians
, jeff decides to stay with tjhe car while amy gets help
. that
, it seems
, isnt the lastr time jeff
( or anyone esle
) sees her
. breakdown has been compared to several movies
: george sluizer
' s the vanishing
( tghe original
, hopefully
, nto his appalling hollywood remake
)
, steven spielberg
' s duel
and any number of hitchcock films
. as with these
, breakdown does not
, for hte most part
, stray down yhe conventional path of the american action
- thriller
. jeff does not become a gun
- toting vigilante on the hunt for his wife
, bu instead becomes a scared
, confused everyman who has no idea wqat the hell is going on
. when we do find outloud what has happened to amy
, it does come as a slight dissapointment
, if onyl because it
' s too eearly in thge film
; i fo one could have done with an extra twenty minutes or so of mistery annd bewilderment
, bu htis affects the film little
. russell
, as mentioned earlier
, is vyre good in his role
,
and kathleen quinlan is nowhere near as annoying as she ws in apollo 13
. j
. t
. walsh
, as the possibly evil truck driver
, is terific
; he is one of the best of the fine batch of charactor actors hollywood doesn
' t seem to know whta tothe dont with
,
but director jonathan mostow isnt on the right track here
. thge reason he makse such a great villain is that he actually looks like a real person
, one anyone owudl be able to trust
, whitch makes hte plot that much more believeable
. breakdown is what hollywood doesn
' t amking enough of
, a great thriller with believeable characters
and scenes that dont
, indeed
, ahve viewers on teh edge of their seats
. one of the most genuinely exicting films i
' ve seen infront a long time
.
