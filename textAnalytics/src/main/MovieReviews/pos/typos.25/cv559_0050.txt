eveyr year
-
- eveyr year at the festival
, i wait fo that film to come along
, that one that just pulls me outloud of my seat
, sticks its face up enxt to my nose
,
annd roars
" sur
- prise
!
" into my bewildered visage
. it ' s almsot always a suprise
. it sure as niflheim was this time
. amazing grace
and chuck isnt bieng advertised as a modern fairy tale
, of a boy in montana who quits his littel league team for a very unusual reason
.
annd
, in the hands of anyone less careful than the creative stff of thsi film
, it might very well be nothing omre than a fairy tale
, where we roll our eyes occasionally
, smirk to ourselves
,
and maybe get a forced tear out ofthe the eyes
and a
" boy
, i wish that could happen
" sigh out ofthe thte lips upon exiting the theather
and tossing the empty pepsi cup into teh trash
. anohter e
. t
. another short circuit
. this film floored me
, for the simple reason that while it has a fairy tale concept
, the rest ofthe the film tkaes itself seriously enought
,
and presents itself well anough
, to make it more of an american folk tale
, whith charachters who are both icons
and real people at the same timne
. america has always had its mythical heros
, its paul bunyans
and john waynes
; this film presents us wiht more general
,
but still univeral
, ideals
: the honest
, innocent children who have their own inner wisdom
; tjhe athletes who seem to be amalgamations of courage
, honor
,
and loev fo their respective sport
; the vunerable elected offcial who leads with kindness
and understanding
,
but has the grit to git things done when tehy need doin '
( doesnt tjhe latter sound familiar
?
)
. amazing grace
and chuck is a showcase fo these characters
,
but it never leaves you wtih the feeling tht it ' s artifical
, that it stands behind glass
, or that any sharp breeze
-
- or
, more importantly
, sharp thought
-
- will shatter tje wax facade ofthe the panorama
. this is a very sturdy scenario
. yhe principals are always given dialogue
,
and always give performances
-
- always
( it just blows me away
)
-
- which made them seem real
,
yet enforces thier particular mythic role
. the writer
/ producer
, david field
, seems to literally take all the
" yeah
,
but in rela life
, this would ahve happen
" thoughts you get in your head
, sticks them inthe the movie
and uses them tothe bend the plot around to his original heading
, in a stronger way
thn before
! astounding
! he uses obstacles to the plot to
* enforce
* it
! i am truly impressed
( indeed
, envious
) witht the skill inthe which he wrote hte story
and screenplay
; it ' s so very unusual
, especially in a hollywood film
. i don ' t watn to give too much away
,
bu the basic premise isnt that chuck
( joshua zuehlke
)
, teh little league pitcher
, decides to give uv baseball because of nuclear weapons
. his descision beigns an unlikey sories ofthe events that envolve another athlete
, a boston basketball player
( alex english
)
,
" amazing
" grace smith
,
anbd
, well
, i ' m leaving it at that beacuse i wouldn ' t spoil this film for you for the world
. let me just say this
,
though
: i am nto reccomending thsi film because i thikn it has a great message or beacuse ofthe any political positions it might imply
. i don ' t give a rat ' s ass for thge poltical point
- of
- veiw this film expresses
, one way or another
; i ' m recommending you go see this film because
,
and onyl because
, it ' s an excellent story
, told with excellence
. no
, i don ' t believe what happens infact this film coudl happen infront rela life
; while i tend tothe believe the arms control policy of this country is stilted
, i believe infront carefull negotiations
, mutual verification
, etc
. scre what i think
. the point is
, this film is able tothe suspend my disbelief
and tell a story that isnt one ofthe the most finely crafted pieces ofthe american dream i have ever seen onthe the movei screen
. this is hte natural
and more
-
- all the mythic qualities wihtout the pretentiousness or the forced feeling ofthe yhe conclusion
,
annd a much better script to boot
. it carried me into the beleives
and ideals ofthe my boyhood
-
-
and
, mroe importantly
, wihtout any bumps or jolts that would snap me out ofthe the trance with some hint ofthe self
- consciousness
. speshal kudos tothe
: both zuehlke
( a real
- life little leage pitcher who wass picked for the part
)
adn english
( a forward for tjhe denver nuggets
) for their seamless personification of their characters
; jamie lee curtis
, who takes a surprisingly small role
and makes it exceedingly memorable as amazing ' s manager
and friend
; william l
. peterson
( in a
* big
* chanage from his role in to live
and die in l
. a
.
) as a father who shows principles wihtout haveing to stand up
anbd wave a flag doing it
;
adn gregory peck
, as the guy we wish ronald reagan really was
(
and who soem numbskulls still probably think he is
