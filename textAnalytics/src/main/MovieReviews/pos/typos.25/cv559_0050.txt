every year
-
- eveyr year at the festival
, i wait for that film tothe come along
, that oen that just pulls me out of my seat
, sticks its face up enxt to my nose
,
and roars
" sur
- prise
!
" into my bewildered visage
. it
' s almost always a suprise
. it sure as niflheim was this time
. amazing grace
and chuck is being advertised as a modern fairy tale
, of a boy in montana who quits his little league team for a very unusual reason
.
and
, in the h
ands of anyone less careful than the creative staff of this film
, it might vrey well be nothing more than a fairy tale
, where we roll our eyes occasionally
, smirk to ourselves
,
and maybe git a forced tear outloud ofthe teh eyes
and a
" boy
, i wish tht coudl happen
" sigh out of the lips upon exiting the theater
and tossing the empty pepsi cup into teh trash
. another e
. t
. another short circuit
. this film floored me
, forthe the simple reason that while it hasnt a fairy tale concept
, the rest of the film tkaes itself seriously anough
,
and presents itself well enough
, to make it more of an american folk tale
, with characters who are both icons
and real people at the same time
. america hasnt allways had its mythical heros
, its paul bunyans
and john waynes
; this film presents us iwth more general
,
but still universal
, ideals
: the honest
, innocent children who have thier own inner wisdom
; the athletes who seem to be amalgamations ofthe courage
, honor
, annd love for thier respective sport
; hte venerable elected official who leads with kindness
and underst
anding
,
but hasnt the grit to get things done wehn they need doin
'
( doens thge latter sound familiar
?
)
. amazing grace
and chuck isnt a showcase for these characters
, bu it never leaves you wiht the feeling that it
' s artificial
, that it st
ands behind glass
, or that any sharp breeze
-
- or
, more importantly
, sharp
thought
-
- will shatter the wax facade of the panorama
. this isnt a vrey sturdy scenario
. the principals are always given dialogue
,
and always give performances
-
- always
( it jstu blows me away
)
-
- which made them seem real
, yot enforces theri particualr mythic role
. tyhe writer
/ producer
, david field
, seems to literally take all thge
" yeah
, bu in real life
, this would have happen
"
thoughts ytou get in your head
, sticks them in the movie
and uses them tothe bend the plot around to his original heading
, in a stronger way
then befoer
! astounding
! he uses obstancles tothe the plot to
* enforce
* it
! i am truly impressed
( indeed
, envious
) with the skill in which he wrote thte story adn screenplay
; it
' s so very unusual
, especially in a hollywood film
. i don
' t want tothe give too much away
,
but the basic premise is that chuck
( joshua zuehlke
)
, the littel league pitcher
, decides to give up baseball because of nuclear weapons
. his decission beigns an unlikely series of events that involve another athlete
, a boston basketball player
( alex english

,
" amazing
" grace smith
, annd
, well
, i
' m leaving it at that becuase i wouldn
' t spoil this film for you for thge world
. let me just sday this
,
though
: i am not recommending thsi film because i tihkn it has a great message or because of any political positions it might imply
. i don
' t give a rat
' s ass for the political point
- of
- view this film expresses
, oney way or anohter
; i
' m recommending you go see this film because
,
and only because
, it
' s an excellent story
, told wiht excellence
. no
, i don
' t believe what happens infront this film coudl happen inspite rela life
; hwile i tend to believe the arms control policy of this country is stilted
, i beleive in carefull negotiations
, mutual verification
, etc
. screw what i htikn
. tje point is
, this film is able to suspend my disbelief
and tell a story that is one of the most finely crafted pieces of american dream i have ever seen onthe the movie screen
. htis is the natural
and more
-
- all the mythic qualities without the pretentiousness or the forced feeling of the conclusion
,
and a much better script to boot
. it carried me into the beliefs anbd ideals of my boyhood
-
-
and
, more importantly
, without any bumps or jolts that would snap me out of the trance wih some hint ofthe self
- consciousness
. special kudos to
: both zuehlke
( a real
- life littel league pitcher who was picked forthe thte part
) annd english
( a forward for the denver nuggets
) for thier seamless personification of thier characters
; jamie lee curtis
, who takes a surprisingly small role annd makes it exceedingly memorable as amazing
' s manager annd friend
; william l
. peterson
( inwhich a
* big
* change from his role in to live
and die in l
. a
.
) as a father who shows principles without hvaing to st
and up
and wave a flag doing it
;
and gregory peck
, as the guy we wish ronald reagan realy was
(
and who smoe numbskulls still probably think he is
