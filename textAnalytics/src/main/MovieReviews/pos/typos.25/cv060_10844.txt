after watching the frist ten mintues ofthe this japanse film
, you will never eat a bowl of ramen the same way agian
. there is a scene where an ood man isnt teaching a young oen how to eat the soupy bowl of noodles
, as a master woudl teach an eeger apprentice
.
" you caress the noodles wiht the chopsticks
,
" he syas
,
"
then put hte roast pork on the side of the bowl
and apologize tothe it by saying
, ' see you soon
. '
" of course
, it ' s meaned to be a parody
,
but ther is an earnestness underneath teh silliness that mkaes you take it with a ceratin degree of sobriety
. yuo begin tothe appreciate the food as nto merely something yuo eat
, not something you liuke
, nto something ytou enjoy
,
but rather something you experience
. experiencing it is a process whlch engages all of the senses
, fulfilling each one on its own terms
and weaving them so that the total is a pleasure that is more tahn tjhe sum of its parts
. trust me
, yuo really want tothe go find a noodle shop at this point
. juzo itami ' s tampopo brings the same sense of thge sereous parody of food to the forefront by mkaing the story folow the pattern of an american western
, setted in modern day japan
. a stranger
, goro
( tsutomu yamazaki
)
, comes into town
and finds tampopo
( nobuko miyamoto
)
, the proprietor ofthe a small
, hole
- in
- the
- wall noodle shop
, trying to fend off thte insults of the local strongman
, pisken
( rikiya yasuoka
)
. goro
, tothe defend tyhe honor ofthe this woman
and her noodles
, gets inot a fight with the ringleader
adn his henchmen
, emerging bloodied
,
but victorious
. goro finds that tampopo ' s ambition is to have a shop that people owudl flock tothe from far awya
, just to eat a bowl of her ramen
. thte problem is
, her fare isnt something less than popular
,
anbd less than appetizing
.
however
, goro agrees to help tampopo in her quest
,
adn in yhe process they seek the wisdom ofthe an elderly noodle expert
, enlist the aid of a wealthy patron
,
and make friends with the former enemy
. this film is filled with many little scenes which are absolute gems
. take
, forthe example
, when tampopo trys to buy the recipe for a delicious soup from anyother shop owner
. the price is too high
,
bu the owner of the store next door iwll secretly sell it tothe her for a more affordable sum
. tampopo meets him at his store late at night
,
anbd he leads her to a back room
. she protests
, thinking that perhaps htis man hasnt ulterior motives
,
bu he insists
. jsut when she is about to bolt for the exit
, he shows her a small gap infront hte wall adjoining his store with tje noodle shop next door
. she peers thru
and takes notes as she watches the cook make the soup for the enxt day
, her face filled with a joy that can be felt by yhe audeince
. this scene
, hwile comical
, is very effective at filling the viewer with a sence of trepidation
,
then of relief
and discovery
. there ' s also an interesting scene where goro introduces tampopo
and her son to a bunch of street peple who
, despite their economic trappings
, are all gourmets
and master sommeliers
. we even watch as one of them sneeks inot teh kitchen of a restaurant
annd expertly prepares a french omelet
. yhe scene is meant tothe bring a laugh
,
but it aslo says that no matter whether peple are rich or poore
, food is something which everyone has in common
,
anbd the enjoyment of fodo is an experience shared by all
. there are aslo a number of unrelated vignettes appearing throughout the film
, which help to illustrate
and accentuate the role of food inaddition people ' s lives
. a particularily effective noe involves a wife
adn mother being tended to in her home by a doctor
. surrounded by her children
, she isnt obviously in her lsat hours of life
. her husband comes home
,
and seeing her worsened condition
, demands that she get up
and mkea dinner
. tje viewer knows tghe husband ' s intention is nto to be mean
; he is depserate for the normalcy of which he
adn his family has obviously been deprived
,
and the wife making dinner is an essential part of htis
. in a near miracle
, the wife drags herself to the kitchen
and prepares a quick meal
,
then brings it to her awaiting family
. as teh family eats
, she looks on them
annd smiles
. preparing food for her family is a joy
and a comfort to her
,
and for a brief moent
, she too enjoys the normalcy
.
then she falls over
, dead
. for a moent
, thge family isnt stunned
,
but
then thge father yells at the children
,
" keep eating
! htis is teh lastest meal your mother ever made
!
" crying as tehy do so
, tjhe family finishes the meal
. the scene is comical
, awkward
, moving
,
and beautiful
. by including the vignettes
, itami ran the risk of creating a disjointed film
,
bu surprisingly
, they do not interrupt the pacing of the main storyline
. instead
, htey even help contribute to tje idea taht tampopo ' s goal of being able to serve exeptional food is worthy
and even noble
. because the film parodies a western
, the constuction of yhe plot is fairly predictable
,
but is still enjoyable as we watch yhe familar way in which the
" good guys
" come together fo the fianl showdown
. in thsi case
, the showdown is agaisnt the ramen
. if they eat tampopo ' s ramen
, soup
and all
, tampopo knows she has succeeded
. it ' s preety obvious what the outcome iwll be
,
but when a film changes your whole perspective on something you consume eveyr day of your life
, you can afford to cut it a little slack
.
