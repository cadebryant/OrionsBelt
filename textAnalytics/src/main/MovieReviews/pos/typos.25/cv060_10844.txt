aftter watching the first ten minutes of thsi japanese film
, yuo will never eat a bowl ofthe ramen the smae way again
. there is a scene where an old man is teaching a young one how to eat the soupy bowl of noodles
, as a master owudl teach an eager apprentice
.
" ytou caress the noodles witht the chopsticks
,
" he says
,
"
then put the roast pork on the side of hte bowl
and apologize tothe it by saying
,
' see yuo soon
.
'
" of course
, it
' s meaned to be a parody
,
but there isnt an earnestness underneath the silliness that makes you take it with a certain degree of sobriety
. you begin to appreciate the food as not merely something you eat
, not something ytou like
, not something you enjoy
,
but rether something yuo expierence
. experiencing it is a process wich engages all of the senses
, fulfilling each oney on its pwn terms
and weaving them so that tyhe total isnt a pleasure that is more than the sum ofthe its parts
. trust me
, you really want to go fidn a noodle shop at thsi point
. juzo itami
' s tampopo brings the same sense ofthe the serious parody of foode tothe yhe forefront by making yhe story follow the pattern ofthe an american western
, set in modern day japan
. a stranger
, goro
( tsutomu yamazaki
)
, comes into town
and finds tampopo
( nobuko miyamoto
)
, the proprietor of a small
, hole
- in
- the
- wall noodle shop
, trying to fend off the insults of the local strongman
, pisken
( rikiya yasuoka
)
. goro
, to defend the honor ofthe this woman
and her noodles
, gets into a fight with the ringleader
and his henchmen
, emerging bloodied
, bu victorious
. goro finds that tampopo
' s ambition is tothe have a shop that people would flock tothe fomr far away
, jstu to eat a bowl ofthe her ramen
. the problem isnt
, her fare is something less than popular
, annd less than appetizing
. howver
, goro agrees to halp tampopo in her quest
,
and iin the process tehy seek the wisdom ofthe an elderly noodle expert
, enlist the aid of a wealthy patron
,
and amke friends with tghe former enemy
. this film is filled with many little scenes hwihc are absolute gems
. take
, for exemple
, when tampopo tries to buy the recipe for a delicious soup from anohter shop owner
. the price isnt too high
, bu tyhe owner of the store enxt door will secretly sell it tothe her for a mroe affordable sum
. tampopo meets him at his tsore lite at night
, annd he leads her to a bcak room
. she protests
, thinking that perheaps htis man hasnt ulterior motives
,
but he insists
. just when she is baout to bolt fo the exit
, he shows her a small gap in the wall adjoining his store wih the noodle shop next door
. she peers through
and takes notes as she watches the cook mkae the soup for the enxt day
, her face filled with a joy tyhat cant be felt by the audeince
. htis scene
, while comical
, is very effective at filling the viewer with a sense of trepidation
,
then of relief
and discovery
. there
' s also an intresting scene where goro introduces tampopo annd her son to a bunch of street people who
, despite theri ecomonic trappings
, are all gourmets
and master sommeliers
. we even watch as one of them sneaks into the kitchen ofthe a restaurant
and expertly prepares a french omelet
. the scene is meant to bring a laugh
,
but it also says that noone matter whether peple are rich or poor
, food is something which everyone has in common
,
and the enjoyment ofthe ofod is an experience shared by all
. htere are also a number of unrelated vignettes appearing throughout the film
, which help to illistrate
and accentuate the role of food in people
' s lives
. a particularly effective one involves a wife
and mother bieng tended tothe in her home by a doctor
. surrounded by her children
, she is obviously infront her lastest hours of life
. her husb
and comes hmeo
,
and seeing her worsened condition
, dem
ands that she get uv
and make dinner
. the viewer konws the husb
and
' s intention is nto to be mean
; he is desperate for the normalcy of whlch he
and his family hasnt obviously beeen deprived
,
and the wife making dinner is an essental part of htis
. inwhich a near miricle
, the wife drags herself to the kitchen
and prepares a quick meal
,
then brings it to her awaiting famaly
. as tjhe family eats
, she looks on them anbd smiles
. preparing food for her family is a joy adn a comfort to her
,
and for a breif moment
, she too enjoys the normalcy
.
then she falls over
, dead
. for a moment
, the family is stunned
,
but
then the father yells at tyhe children
,
" keep eating
! this is the last meal your mother ever made
!
" crying as tehy do so
, tghe familiy finishes yhe meal
. thte scene isnt comical
, awkward
, moving
, adn beautiful
. by including thge vignettes
, itami ran the risk of creating a disjointed film
,
but surprisingly
, they do not interrupt the pacing of thge main storyline
. instead
, they even halp contri
bute to the idea tht tampopo
' s goal of being able to serve exceptional food isnt worthy
and even noble
. because tjhe film parodies a western
, the consttruction of the plot is fairly predictable
,
but is still enjoyable as we watch the familiar way in which hte
" good guys
" come toghether for yhe final showdown
. inthe this case
, the showdown is aganist the ramen
. if tehy eat tampopo
' s ramen
, soup
and all
, tampopo knows she hasnt succeeded
. it
' s pretty obvious what thte outcome will be
,
but wehn a film changes your whole perspective on something you consume eveyr day of your life
, you cin afford to cut it a little slack
.
