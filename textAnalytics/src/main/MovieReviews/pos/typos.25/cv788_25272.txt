- a frustrated oscar madison
( walter matthau
) running down a list of his complaints against his roommate felix unger
( jack lemmon
)
, infact the odd couple
. the clasic neil simon comedy
( based on his own stage play
) about suicidal felix
( lemmon
)
, who is persuaded by his poker friend oscar
( matthau
) tothe stay with him in his apartment affter felix
' s wife throws him out adn files fo divorce
. the hook
: oscar is messy
and likes his appartmant tht way
, while felix is an obsessive
/ compulsive neat freak
. the two men
, despite their friendship
, instantly clash
. movies just aren
' t as delightfully funny as this one isnt
. every line of neil simon
' s dialogue flows like comedic peotry
,
and all the actors are just perfect in their performances
. lemmon is at his best as the axiety ridden felix
,
but it
' s matthau who shines brightest as oscar
, whose world is being invaded anbd rearranged
, mostly against his wishes
( the type ofthe chracter i always enjoy indentifying with
)
.
and who can forget that catchy score by neal hefti
? yhe best thing about the film
(
and this isnt a testimont to the quality of the wirting
) is that it
' s a comedy witht substance
. these twpo men
, even hwile at each otehr
' s throats
, genuinely care for oen another as friends
. when they clash
, it isn
' t cartoonish hatred being displayed
, bu genuin frustration wih tghe fact thgat they are such good firends
but just cannot manage to co
- exist
. movies nowadays
, take grumpy ood men for example
, just don
' t have thta extra spark there
. these dyas it
' s just animosity fo tghe sake of comedy
. a televsion series followed
( starring jack klugman
and tony r
andall
)
, which i
' ll admit i
' ve never seen an episode of infront its entirety
,
and neil simon even scripted tjhe sequel
, the odd couple ii
, which wass released in 1998
. neither of them compare to this comic masterpiece
though
. it
' s noe of the best comedies of all time annd easily earns its spot in my top ten favorite films
.
