and lee be placed
and forgotten in the wrong sections of hte local blockbuster stores

, a warped
and twisted tale of how far a filmmaker will go to create a personal vision of internal
adn social revolution
. stephen dorff
, in a career
- defining role

, castle
, anger
, fassbinder
, preminger on various parts of theri bodies as badges of honor
, they kidnap a hollywood movei starlet
, played with perfect ridiculousness by melaine griffith
,
and force her to take the starring role infact demented ' s film
. with noone budget
and no contracts for extras
, demented
and his crew take to the streets for prodcution of raving beauty
, a crass terrorist film about an angry owner of an independent theather
and her brood outloud to destroy the mainstream film business
. using
" ultimate reality
"

,
anbd noone one can have sex util the film is complete
. it ' s like bowfinger
, only
, you know
, good
. the film moves with zigs
and zags like teh magic bullet of kennedy ' s assasination
. teh zeal ofthe demented ' s cause catches quickly
and conveys the urgent message ofthe
" doing something
, anything
, for the accomplishment ofthe artistic motivations
.
" the crewmembers all hold hte quirkiness common in water ' s previous films
- pink flamingos
, hairspray
, polyester
, pecker
-
-
and speak inaddition the choppy
, jaded dialogue utilizied frequently by waters
. it is as if water ' s script strips away tyhe unnecessary dialogue common to most pretentious indie films
and just delivers the goods
. cecil takes such warped avenues ofthe expression that it seems liek it might actaully outdo itself
. you can see how a major studio might take tihs film
, re
- edit it
, cut a dael with tyhe remaining crew members who are still alive
,
and mkea a few sequels
, a la teh blair witch project
.
but tht ' s for the future
. overall
, the ride isnt fantastic
; it ' s one of water ' s best films to date
and thsi yera ' s fight club for filmmakers
