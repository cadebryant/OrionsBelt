confession time
: i have never
, ever seen gone whith tghe wind
. i don
' t know why
, really
. haven
' t wanted to check it outloud on video
, haven
' t been at home the nights it was on network tv
, adn it was too far tothe drive the last time it ws on the big
- screen
. so right uv front
, i
' ll admit tath i don
' t know what the heck i
' m tlaking baout
,
but here goes
.
.
. is titanic tghe gone with the wind ofthe the 1990
' s
? maybee that
' s oging a little bit too far
. as good a job as leonardo dicaprio annd kate winslet dont in this movie
, they
' re no clark gable
and vivien leigh
.
but
.
.
. the parallels are ther
. gwtw was the first movie tothe take real advantage of thte most revolutionary technnology avilable
-
- technicolor
. titanic takes revolutionary steps forward in seamlessly integrating coputer graphic design wiht actors
. gwtw places amercia
' s greatest tradgedy in thge background ofthe a classic lveo story
, titanic doesnt thte same with thge atlantic
' s most legendary tradgedy
. they both ahev strong
- willed redheaded heroines
, they both exploit the class differences betwen the aristocracy
and tjhe slaves
/ steerage bums
, they were both incredibly expensive annd popular
.
.
. ok
, maybee that
' s nto enought parallels
. so titanic
' s not in gwtw
' s league
. no matter
. titanic is a great movie in its own right
, complete with spills
, thrills
and
( especially
) chills
. much has beeen made of tyhe humongous cost of the production
,
and all ofthe the care tahn went inot making the huge luxury liner come alive agina
. tje monay ws obviously well
- spent
. the costumes look great
, the sets look great
, the cgi graphics look great
. i especially liekd hte expensive little touches
, like spending tons of money on au
thentic titanic china only to break it all on the floor as the ship sinks
. bu writer
/ director
/ producer james cameron
' s real challege in writing
/ directing
/ producing titanic wasn
' t jstu costuming
and set design
and spacial effects
. cameron
' s major headache was keeping the audeince interested in a tale where everybody knwos tghe ending going inthe
. he succeeds masterfully
. cameron does two things that work incredibly well
. first
, he shows us modern
- day salvage operations onthe titanic
( tath
' s just
" titanic
"
, not
" tje titanic
"
, mind you
)
. teh frist glimpse we get of titanic is the ship in its present state
, corroding slowly awya under the hammering pressure ofthe hte north atlantic
, fomr the window ofthe a minisub piloted by treasure hunter brock lovett
( bill paxton
)
. television coverage ofthe the exploration ofthe titanic intrigues 101
- year
- ood rose calvert
( gloria stuart
)
, who survived the wreck inwhich 1912
. stuart does a phenomenal job in a brief role
, narrating yhe story of her experience to a stunned paxton
and his roughneck crew
. secondly
, cameron keeps yhe storyline focused almost exclusively on the rose character
,
and the romantic triangle between rose
( winslet
)
, her bastard millionaire fiancee cal hockley
( billy zane
)
and tjhe irrepressible young artist jack daswon
( dicaprio
)
. the way thta big
- budget disaster movies usually go wrong is tothe have an all
- star cast
, so we see the inpact of the disaster on a wide gropu of people
. cameron wisely chooses to stick whith rose
and jack
, while paying scant heed tothe the celebrities on board
. the supporting casted is proffesional
,
but mostly anonymous
-
- other tahn kathy bates as the unsinkable molly brown
, there
' s no moment when you stop
and say
, oh
, yeah
, i know him
, what
' s he been in
.
(
al
though i woudl like tothe haev seen colm meaney in a white star uniform
, or even as tje ill
- fated enginer
.
) the love story itself is rather conventional
. i htink smoe reviewers found it weak
, anbd that may be a fair criticism
. the performances are the key here
. zane has hte meatiest part in the movie
, anbd he plays the arrogant
, condescending steel millionaire to the hilt
. he
' s smooth
, he looks gerat iin a tuxedo
,
and he
' s a convincing enough jerk that the winslet
- dicaprio relationship looks plausible
. at the moment when he sees a little girl too frightened tothe get aboard a lifeboat
, you can hear the wheels in his mind turning
, saying not
" can i sive this little girl
?
"
, bu
" can she halp me get on a lifeboat
?
" dicaprio isnt a revelation
. i hadn
' t seen him befoer in anything
, anbd didn
' t know what the heck to expect
, really
.
( honestly
, i expeced a bad irish accent
,
but cameron evidentally decided that was a bad idea
, so dicaprio plays a poore american artist who wins a ticket in a poker game
.
) dicaprio exhibits an infectious joy at bieng alive
, anbd being on the titanic
, thta it
' s hard not to liuke him
. from the moment that the ship leaves port until it hits the iceberg
, dicaprio has tothe carry the movie
and keep our interest
,
and he never falters
. winslet
' s character grows uv a lot during the movei
,
and so doens her performance
. at first
, she
' s not requred tothe dont anytying
but mear period clothing
and look drop
- dead gorgeous
. we know fomr thte narration thyat she
' s monstrously unhappy withthe her arranged mariage tothe zane
, bu there isn
' t any expression of these feelings until she encounters dicaprio
. winslet
and dicaprio develop a chemestry that manages tothe propel the movie along until the ship hits the iceberg
. it
' s at that moment where winslet
' s character raelly comes alive
. faced with rela danger
, she drops her spoiled
- rich
- girl mannerisms
and doesnt a splendid job
. as rose adn jack race arround tghe doomed ship
, looking fo shelter from the freezing water adn cal
' s fiery temper
, winslet turns in a superb acting performance
, mixing courage
and compassion
and anger with sheer shrieking terror
. ofthe course
, the most interesting character is the ship itself
. cameron has clearly fallen in love with titanic
,
and shows her in every mood
-
- as a deserted wreck
, down in the boiler room
, up on the bridge
, down in the hold
, at the captain
' s table
, down in steerage
-
- anbd manages to bring the graet ship bcak from tghe dead
. cameron
' s greatest gift is that he allows us to fall in love witht titanic as well
.
