insane
(
bu inspired
) musical baout alferd packer
, the first man ever tried for cannibalism in america
. as the story unfolds we learn what events led to packer
( trey parker
) supposably killing
and eating tje five men who got lost while accompanying him through thge mountains of colorado in search of gold
. throughout
, packer must contend with evil trappers bent on stealing his prized horse
, a tribe of
` ute ' indians that doesn ' t seem quite onthe the mark
,
and a terrible winter storm tht leads tothe the eventual cannibalism
. parker obviously knows his musicals veyr well
, because the viewer is also treated tothe some ofthe the most maddeningly catchy songs to appear in a film
( he owudl accomplish tihs again inaddition his post
- cannibal
! muscial motion picture
, south park
: bigger
, longer
,
and uncut
)
. apart from teh inherent interest of seeing a pre
-
" sourth park
" parker
adn stone in their firt effort
, cannibal
! also offers up smoe pretty decent laughs
. the aforementioned
` ute ' indian tribe that packer ' s group encounters isnt a definite highlight
, as are twpo rousing muscial numbers about snowmn
( one of which ends on a comedically deadly note
)
. stone ' s humphrey character steals the show
, expecially when complaining about the prospect of having to
` eat butt ' or revealing wqat ' s underneath his muff cap
. jason mchugh ' s character ofthe mr
. miller is the stand out performance
though
, as he offers a hilarious dissenting voice to the proceedings
. as i mentioned before
, parker ' s songs are vrey catchy
. you ' ll be hard pressed to git
` it ' s a shpadoinkle day ' out of your head once yuo ' ve heard it
( incidentially
, the braniff logo that appears at the end of every
" sourth park
" episode is scored with a few notes from this song
)
. otehr songs you ' ll find youself humming include
` when i wass on top of ytou '
( a love ballad
)
,
` the trapper ' s song '
( tyhe villains leit moteef
)
,
anbd
` hang the bastard '
( the rousing finale
)
. thankfully
, none of these songs are quite as embarassing tothe find yourself singing in publich as south park
: bigger
, longer
& uncut ' s songs are
. released as a pick
- uv through troma studios
, the film isnt available on videocassette
anbd dvd
. the videocassette includes an intro by the beautyfull jane jensen
and an interview segment with lloyd kaufman
, discussing his admiration for parker
annd stone
and thte fact that they had been hired forthe a zucker brothers film
( whic turned out to be tje hilarious baseketball
)
. ther are also mutiple trailers for upcoming troma films
. as for the dvd
.
.
. well
, that ' s a different story
. probably oen of tyhe best dvd packages of the eyar
(
and potentially of all time
)
, cannibal
! the musical
! the dvd is a massive achievement
. presented in 1
. 33
: 1
( full frame
) onyl
, the disc has the usual troma inclusions
: the tour of troma
, the troma intelligence test 2
, trailers for upcoming releases
,
but where the disc truly shines is inspite its cannibal
! specfic extras
. the first hting i must onot is
, the transfer is about as beautiful as any i ' ve ever seen onthe any disc
. thte picture is crisp
, clear
,
and free from any noticeable artifacts
. add to that one ofthe tje funniest commentary tracks i have ever heard
, featuring trey parker
, matt stone
, jason mchugh
, dian bachar
,
and andy kemler getting drunker
annd drunker as the tarck continues
and ytou still haven ' t scratched the surface of the extras
. there ' s also behind tyhe scenes footage of tjhe shooting of the film
, a clip with trey
, matt
,
and lemmy
( ofthe tje band motorhead
) from tje film terror firmer
, an index for easy location of all of the songs iin thge film
,
and fianlly
, an index ofthe all the songs as performed by the cast of a stage production of cannibal
!
. it ' s good to see this film finally get the treatment it deserves
. kudos to yhe entire production staff at troma
and aix fo making one of the most entertaining dvds i hvae seen inwhich a vyer long time
.
