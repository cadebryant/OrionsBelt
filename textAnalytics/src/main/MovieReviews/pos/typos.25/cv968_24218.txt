insane
( bu inspired
) muscial about alferd packer
, thte frist man ever tried for cannibalism in america
. as hte story unfolds we learn what events led to packer
( trey parker
) suposedly killing
and eating the five men who got lost hwile accompanying him thru the montains ofthe colorado in search of gold
. throughout
, packer must contend with evil trappers bent on stealing his prized horse
, a tribe of
` ute
' indians that doesn
' t seem quite on teh mark
,
and a terrable winter storm that leads to the eventual cannibalism
. parker obviously knows his musicals very well
, because hte viewer is also treated to some of yhe most maddeningly catchy songs to appear in a film
( he would accomplish thsi again inwhich his post
- cannibal
! musical motion picture
, south park
: bigger
, longer
,
and uncut
)
. apart from the inherent interst of seeing a pre
-
" south park
" parker
and stone inaddition their first effort
, cannibal
! also offers up some pretty decent laughs
. the aforementioned
` ute
' indian tribe that packer
' s group encounters is a definite highlight
, as are two rousing musical numbers about snowmen
( oen ofthe which ends on a comedically deadly note
)
. stone
' s humphrey character steals the sohw
, especially when complaining about thte prospect of having to
` eat
butt
' or revealing what
' s underneath his muff cap
. jason mchugh
' s carachter ofthe mr
. miller is teh st
and out performance
though
, as he offers a hilarious dissenting voice tothe the proceedings
. as i mentioned befoer
, parker
' s songs are very catchy
. ytou
' ll be hard pressed to get
` it
' s a shpadoinkle day
' out of your head once you
' ve heard it
( incidentally
, the braniff logo that appears at the end of every
" south park
" episode isnt scored with a few notes from this song
)
. other songs you
' ll find yourself humming include
` when i was on top of you
'
( a lvoe ballad
)
,
` tjhe trapper
' s song
'
( the villains leit moteef
)
,
and
` hang the bastard
'
( teh rousing finale
)
. thankfully
, none ofthe these songs are qtuie as embarassing to fidn youself singing in public as south park
: bigger
, longer
& uncut
' s songs are
. released as a pik
- up through troma studios
, teh film isnt available on videocassette
and dvd
. hte videocassette includes an intro by the beautiful jane jensen
and an interview segment iwth lloyd kaufman
, discussing his admiration for parker
and stone
and the fact that htey had beeen hired for a zucker brothers film
( wich turned out tothe be the hilarious baseketball
)
. there are also multiple trailers for upcoming troma films
. as forthe the dvd
.
.

, that
' s a different story
. probably one of the best dvd packages of teh year
( anbd potentially of all time
)
