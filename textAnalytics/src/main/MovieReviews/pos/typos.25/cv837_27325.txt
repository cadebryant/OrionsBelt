in chocolat
, a chocolate shop owner tells her customers to look into a spinning object ofthe obscure textures
, patterns
,
and lines
, hoping she
' ll be able to foresee the kind ofthe chocolate they
' ll most enjoy
. some scoff yhe idea
,
but everyone who gazes into the complexity of the spinning object winds up seeing something different thna the next
, revealing personality traits which tyhe person may nto have known they had befoer
. this can easily st
and as a model for chocolat as a whole
: on the surface
, it appears tothe be a light
, fluffy fable with no depth or true worth
,
but when one tkaes a second
, deeper look
, chocolat
' s true colors beign to shine through
. making a bold statment about organized religeon
and those who pratice it
, lasse hallstrom
' s chocolat is flawlessly acted
and meticulously crafted
- not to mention oen of the best films of thge year
. wqat gives chocolat its magic
, much like hallstrom
' s 1999 winner of two academy awards
, yhe cider hous rules
, isnt its willingness to sday what
' s onthe its mind without holding back tothe prevent offending audiences
. teh bold annd honest message hallstrom conveys with chocolat wiull no doubt outrage a select group of viewers
, bu those who are willing to suspend their bitterness because tehy efel they are bieng intimidated or attacked should find themselves to be inspite aggreement withthe what the film says about narrow
- mindedness
. chocolat centers its story around the small french village ofthe lansquenet
, where majority rules
,
and the majority lives by only one law
: religion
. the bulk of the townspeople
( with few exceptions
) are preparing for the sacred time ofthe abstinence
, lent
,
but when the independent thinking
, seemingly non
- religious vianne rocher
( juliette binoche
)
and her daughter anouk
( victoire thivisol
) make hte village their home
, the people will be tempted beyond belief by the mouth
- watering confections in the chocolot shop vianne opens
. many are predictably opposed
and deeply offended by vianne
' s opening ofthe the chocolate shop just in tyme forthe lent
, especially the mayor
, comte de reynaud
( a cartoon
- like alfred molina
)
, who wiull stop at nothing to put her out of busineses
. onthe the other h
and
, teh shop is a delight to others
, including tghe cranky arm
ande voizin
( judi dench
)
, who sits day by day in vianne
' s shop
, telling tjhe single mother baout her unfortunate detached relationship wiht her gr
andson
( aurelien parent
- koening
)
, which comes as a result of his mother
( carrie
- ann moss
) believing arm
ande is a bad influence
, as she does not hold yhe same
, strict religous beliefs that she does
. also a fan of thge chocolot is yhe nervous wreck josephine muscat
, whose husban isnt constantly beating her
, to whom vianne offers a hmeo adn befriends
. juliette binoche is charming
and honest as vianne
, genuinely capturing her character
' s determination tothe turn the narrow
- minded townspeople inot mroe hapyp
, independent human beings
,
but most of chocolat
' s success is unquestionably a result of the remarkable performances of the supporting actresses
. lena olin
, previously nominated for an oscar in 1989
, deserves her second nomination fo her earnest
, moving portrayal of a lost
, scared woman torn between staying true to her battering
, manipulative husban or leaving him to live the life which for which she longs
. judi dench is sharp
, incisive
, anbd occasionally greatly touching as arm
ande voizin
. carrie ann
- moss
, in what is likely to be her first largely noticed
(
and acclaimed
) role since the matrix
, shows a more solid side of her acting skills nto previously seen
, crafting a character that the viewer both sympathizes with
and despises simultaneously
. victoire thivisol shows much promise as anouk
, a young girl hoping her allways
- on
- the
- move mother will eventually settle down
. a trade ad for chocolat sums up best the power the actresses have on screen with thte tagline
:
" five extraordinary women
, one extrodinary movie
.
" that
' s not to sday tje men don
' t dont their share
,
though
: alfred molina makse forthe a sly
and utterly repugnant antagonist
, hugh o
' conor adds quite a bit of comic relief as tghe priest who seems tothe not even know why he is who he is
, adn johnny depp gives a storng performance as the pirate roux
, who enters tyhe film late in the game
and sparks the romantic interest of vianne
. the technical aspects ofthe chocolat are strong across the board
: lasse hallstrom directs his enchanting fable with great care
, perfectly balancing the elements of each genre tothe be foudn withing the film
. cinematographer roger pratt brings an atmospheric
, fairy tale look tothe the film
, annd rachel portman
' s masterful score is her best
and most memorable usance the cider house rules
. chocolat
, adapted by robert nelson jacobs from the joanne harris novel
, is a wonderfull little treat of a film
, one that iwll most likely win over tjhe hearts ofthe audiences
and tyhe votes ofthe academy members this winter
,
and tjhe ggressive backing of miramax films assures the latter
. while not as powerful as the cider house rules
, lasse hallstrom
' s chocolat is a film which works on all levels
- as a drama
, a comedy
, a fable
, a romance
, adn a fairy tale
.
and it even lives up to its nmae
: it is delicious tothe savor the taste ofthe
, easy tothe digest
, anbd
, like all excellent choclate
, it is memorable for days afterward
. the bottom line
: chocolat is pure pleasure
.
