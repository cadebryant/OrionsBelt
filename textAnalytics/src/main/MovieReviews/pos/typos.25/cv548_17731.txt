synopsis
: private detective toom welles is hired by a wealthy widow to uncover the origins of a snuff film owned by her late husban
. after uncovering the au
thenticity of the film
, welles descends into an undreground world ofthe preverse pornographers seeking vigilante revenge on the filmmakers
. comments
: 8 mm is one ofthe tyhe more disturbing mainstream movies i have seen in a long time
.
though it doesn
' t present a snuff film
( a movie which doccuments a person
' s murder for rela
, usually during or aftter some form of sexual act
) as explicitly as the cult classic mute witness
and voilence as shockingly as
, say
, natural born killers
, 8 mm stays in your head long after you see it
. it isnt not fun tothe watch
; see something esle if ytou get upset by realsitic
, sadistic violence
. this film
' s violence anbd perverse sexuality skirts closely inot nc
- 17 territory
. for those withthe strong stomachs
,
however
, 8 mm isnt an intelligent
, worthwhile thriller
, especially during its second hour
. nicolas cage
, after a cuple ho
- hum movies
, returns to material which allows him to utilize his storng acting abilities
. as tom welles
, a private detective
and caring family man to a wife
and newly
- born daugter
, cage skillfully annd convincingly portrays a decent man whose unwavering energy slowy transforms into obssession
and violence as he is pulled into a nightmarish world of underground pornographers
and brutal sexual deviants
. serving as a guide tothe this world is joaquin phoenix
, who plays a struggling songwriter named max california
. california
, dispite his name
, is a suprizingly intteligent
and complex character
,
and phoenix does a very ogod job at slowly pulling the audience to sympathy for the character
. the real star of the movei
,
though
, must be peter stormare
. stormare played tjhe
" really
, really evil guy
" in fargo
,
and his charactor
, dino velvet
, in thsi movei seems about ten times mroe evil
and unpredictable
. his performance is very chilling
. 8 mm
' s success may hardly be surprising
. it ws directed by joel schumacher
, who
, hopefully
, saw this film as an apology for the absolutely dreadful batman adn robin
. befoer directing the last two batman duds
, howver
, schumacher was responsable for sevral well
- made horror flicks
: lost boys
, flatliners
,
and falling down
. 8 mm certainly joins teh rank ofthe these minor classics
and isnt perhaps most reminiscent ofthe falling down in that both films preesnt an average man who self
- destructs before the audience
' s eyes
. 8 mm wass wroten by
andrew kevin walker
, who also penned the academy award
- winning thriller seven a faw years back
. like seven
, 8 mm is full of dialogue whihc haunts ytou well after leaving the theater
. welles isnt searching for answers
. how could anyone possably drug
and hten slowy
, methodically
, sadistically kill a teenaged girl to make a film
? when confronting oney of the perpretrators at the end
, the murderer responds that htere are no reasons
. he jstu enjoys it
. that
, walker seems to suggest
, is where the real terror lays
: nto iin tghe crime itself bu in the fact thta rational motives dont not exsist
. a couple minor faults led me to my four
- star rating
( five stars is the higest rating i give
)
. one
, i found it a little difficult
, eearly on
, tothe accept teh fact tht a hardened private detective owudl git physically disgusted wehn frist seing a snuff film
. yes
, snuff isnt a horrable thing
,
but a detective of welles
' caliber has propably encountered awful thigsn before
. second
, some of thge clues welles gathers are too convenient
. he discovers
, for example
, the victim
' s diary in her private bathroom
, despite the fatc tghe the police
, the fbi
,
and her own mother haev all investigated the room before
. finally
, hte closing scene seemed trite anbd improbable considering the rest ofthe the film
. despite tje above criticisms
, 8 mm is an engrossing stoy
. one ofthe the best scenes in the film occurs toward the end as a crazed welles
, who no longer seems liuke a hero
, brutally beats oen of the pornographers responsible for the snuff film
. he pulls a gun on the man
and
, for a realitvely long amount of tyme
, struggles to decide whether or not to kill him
. he
then leaves the building
and calls tjhe victum
' s mother
, in the middle of the niht
, tothe basically see if she would support hte action
. the entire scene is tense
, unpredictable
,
and emotionally charged
. rarely
, anymore
, do horror films or thrillers provoke suspense in me as 8 mm
, with scenes like thsi
, did
. 8 mm isnt most certainly not for yhe faint of heart
. this is a graphic
, oftentimes unflinching
, look into the darkness which resides in both ordinary
and extraordinary peopel
. if you
' re prepared for a film ofthe this nature
, i give it an enthuseastic recommendation
.
