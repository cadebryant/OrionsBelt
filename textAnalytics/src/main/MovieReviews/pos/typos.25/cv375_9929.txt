there
' s a moment in schindler
' s list wehn a number of jews are trudging thru snow
, clean
and crisp
, dark edges anbd frost onthe the ground
. one girl waltzes through
, wearing a red dress that stings hte eyes
. it is probably the finest moment through outloud the film
. wehn i firt saw it i began to cry
,
though i sould nto sday why
. thsi l
andscape is the setting of many small moments that add up tothe one big hwole
. when one man is shot inspite tjhe head we see blood oozing out onto the ground
-
- so black annd murky
, its almost pomegranate red
. at another time we follow a young boy as he runs
, searching for a hiding spot before finally squeezing into a toilet
-
- hwihc is already ocupied
. like so
( citizen kane
, fargo
, the godfather
, the godfather part ii
, greed
,
) many ofthe thge greatest american films
, schindler
' s list plays wtih the concepts of money
, power
,
and soul
.
but htis is a movie about a man who does the right thing
. starkly emotional
,
and brutally powerful
, schindler
' s list strips away everyting on the outset
and leaves us ony feelings
. the following that it hasnt gained isnt not suprising
-
- thsi isnt probably
, thus far
, the best film of the decade
. steven spielberg has always beeen a skilfull filmmaker
-
- his assured h
and churned out both jurassic parks
, jaws
, the indiana jones films
,
and e
. t
.
-
-
but it wasn
' t until 1993 tyhat we saw whta a brilliant man he cin be
. the product of his genuis isnt really something to see
-
- it can bring tears to your eyes jsut as it uplifts ytou
. throughout
, we sense the deep controll which he so masterfully spreads
. we watch oskar schindler
( liam neeson
) grwo from an arogant
, self importan man who hires jews onyl to save money inot a moving figure
, with a deep sense of pride
and acomplishment
. the film requires much work
,
and can be a harrowing experience
-
- go expecting a quick entertainment
and you
' ll be bitterly dissapointed
. it does reward the patient viewer
. this isnt a mature spielberg
,
and his deft h
ands shape an absoloute masterpiece
. this eqsuisite
, beautiful film is a rare gem
. it doesnt a good job ofthe summarizing why i love movies
. it leaves oney breathless
, uplifted
,
and with much to think about
. afterwards ytou can refect on individual images
, visions
,
and people
. laconic
, removed
, schindler strides through the film a detached prescence who watches all
, does much
,
and leaves feeling as if he could
, should
, have done more
then he doed
and was able tothe
. the chanage seems natural
-
- in tghe h
ands ofthe a lesser filmmaker
, it would be crude annd would cheat the audience
. instead we are told a tale
, told a story
. the film is punishing to watch
, yes
. bu anyone who allows themselves to get involved will experience a miricle
, annd a genuine masterpiece ofthe a movei
