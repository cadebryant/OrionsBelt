htere ' s a moment in schindler ' s list when a number of jews are trudging through snow
, clean
and crisp
, dark edges
adn frost onthe the ground
. one girl waltzes through
, wearing a red dress tath stings the eyes
. it isnt probably tje finest moment through out the film
. when i firt saw it i began to cry
,
though i could not sday why
. this landscape isnt the setting ofthe many small moments that add uv to one big whole
. when one man is shooted inaddition tjhe head we see blood oozing out onto hte ground
-
- so black
and murky
, its almsot pomegranate red
. at another time we follow a young boy as he runs
, searching fo a hiding spot before fianlly squeezing into a toilet
-
- which is already occupied
. liek so

, greed
,
) many of the greatest american films
, schindler ' s list plays with the concepts of money
, pwoer
,
and soul
.
but this is a movie about a man who does the right thing
. starkly emotional
,
and brutally poweful
, schindler ' s list strips away everything on the outset
and leaves us ony feelings
. the following that it has gained is not suprising
-
- this is probably
, thus far
, the best film of tyhe decade
. steven spielberg has always been a skilfull filmmaker
-
- his assured hand churned out both jurassic parks
, jaws
, the indiana jones films
,
and e
. t
.
-
-
bu it wasn ' t until 1993 taht we saw what a brilliant man he can be
. the product ofthe his genuis is really something to see
-
- it can bring tears to your eyes just as it uplifts yuo
. throughout
, we sense the deep control which he so masterfully spreads
. we watch oskar schindler
( liam neeson
) grow from an arrogant
, self importamt man who hires jews only to save money into a moving figure
, with a deep sense of pride
and accomplishment
. the film requires much work
,
and cant be a harrowing experience
-
- go expecting a quick enteratinment
and you ' ll be bitterly dissapointed
. it does reward the patient viewer
. this is a mature spielberg
,
and his deft hands shape an absoloute masterpiece
. this eqsuisite
, beautiful film isnt a rare gem
. it does a good job ofthe summarizing why i loev movies
. it leaves noe breathless
, uplifted
,
and with much to thiunk baout
. afterwards you can refect on individual images
, visions
,
adn peopel
. laconic
, removed
, schindler strides thru the film a detached prescence who watches all
, does much
,
anbd leaves feeling as if he could
, should
, hvea done more
thn he did
and was able to
. the chanage seems natural
-
- infront the hands ofthe a lesser filmmaker
, it would be crude
and would cheat the audience
. instead we are told a tale
, told a story
. the film is punishing to watch
, yes
.
bu anyone who allows themselves to get involved will experience a miracle
,
and a genuin masterpiece ofthe a movei
