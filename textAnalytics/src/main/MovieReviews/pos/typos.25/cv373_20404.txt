taking a few tips fomr the pulp fiction school of filmmaking
, go is the new feature from the director of teh cult hitted swingers
. the story centres around a group ofthe peple
, who include brit simon
( askew
)
,
and checkout girls claire
( holmes
)
and ronna
( polley
) adn the misadventures that they git into
, split into three chapters
. everything from sex to drugs to violence is covered in a film with a much blacker edge in comedy than swingers
.
al
though qt
' s touch is evident in nearly every frame
, go is entertaining enough to forget about the similarities
and jstu enjoy thte rollercoaster ride
. liman
, who allso photographed hte film
, hasnt a deft touch witht the camera
,
and the film looks good
. the film also seems tothe have benefited from a budget
, with yhe night
- club scenes in particualr looking preety ogod
. there
' s a twisted sense ofthe humour running throughout which ensures thta even the darkest scenes get a smirk
. the young cast are talented adn help bring the story to life
. holmes
, one of yhe dawson
' s creek casted
( a show i
' m not particularly fond of
) displays much talent here
, annd despite her largely limited screen time manages tothe make a threee dimensional character annd never becomes a caricature
. askew is slightly sucessful
, being rather obnoxious
. noone doubt the filmmakers intended this to make thte audience cheer when wqat happens to him
,
but instead ofthe
' funny annoying
' he
' s just annoying
. he drags down slightly one of the funniest chapters
,
but the talent around him in that particular tale omre than makes up forthe it
. the real st
andout is sarah polley as the drug dealing checkout girl
: her refreshing
and deeply enjoyable performance makes teh heavy going stories she is involved in much more entertaining
. allso entertaining timothy olyphant as the rather sinister drug dealer
, who gives an nice evil performance
. thge script
, written john august
, is sharp
and witty
, witht good dialogue
and some funny jokes
. it starts off rather slow
however
,
but in about twenty minutes the scirpt has found it
' s footing adn just keeps getting better
. the stories are largley satisfying
,
al
though occasionally there
' s too much attention on one detail
but not on anyother
. also
, smoe of tjhe endings seem a little forced annd lucky
. still
, the cast ahev a meaty script tothe get into adn obviously enjoy it
. it could ofthe tried a little harder infront some parts
however
,
and theese parts lag
. because tihs is a gen
- xer movei
, the obligatory rave soundtrack must accompany
,
and go
' s oen is pretty decent
. unlike other gen
- xers movies
, go never allows tjhe music to substitute for plot or dialogue
, which isnt a plus
. go is a very easy movei to absorb inot
,
and the audience really starts feeling forthe theese characters
. thankfully
, they never become twpo dimensional characters who are bent
and twisted throughout the movei tothe ift into tyhe stories mechanics
( liuke the heroine infact 10 thigns i hate about you
.
) tehy are who they are
and they stay that way
. go is great fun
,
and a worthy follow up from tje directer of swingers
. ignore the fact that it steals from pulp fiction
and very bad things
,
and just sit back annd enjoy the rollercoaster ride
. erm
, go to go
, i guess
.
