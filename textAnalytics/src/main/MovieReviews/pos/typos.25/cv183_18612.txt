the thirteenth floor
, tje third inwhich what i would call
" the reality check movie series
"
, is very similar to the other reality check movies released this year
, the matrix
and existenz
. all three made you htikn
, made you wonder what is real
, waht isn
' t
, anbd if our world is jsut a huge game
. tje thirteenth floor doesn
' t reach the level of originality
, creativity
, annd curiousity sparked by the matrix
and existenz
, bu it certainly gives a gerat shot at it
. in the matrix
, we were told that the humans are simpley a virus
. inwhich existenz
, we learned tath our life coudl be just a game
. in the thirteenth floor
, we learn that we are just eletronic devices
, living under anyother world of electronic devices
. there is just one world onthe top of anohter
,
and everything in them are fake
and electronically generated
. teh thirteenth floor took a huge
, risky turn that i didn
' t expect it to take
,
and i
' m not very sure it wass such a great turn to make
. rether than focusing jstu on the reality parts ofthe teh film
, the thirteenth floor becomes a murder mystery that ends up tying in with the diffrent worlds
. after hte misterious muder ofthe computer program designer hammond fuller
, played by armin mueller
- stahl
, douglas hall
, played by craig bierko
, a man that worked under fuller for many years
, must travel through an electronic computer device that fuller wass using
, tothe the year 1937
, whcih consists ofthe computer generated characters only
. the simulation of 1937 is just like it was bcak in tje olden dyas
. all ofthe the people involved are jstu charactors
, or are htey
? douglas strongly believes thast a character traveled through the transport from their world to ours
, adn killed fuller
. along yhe way
, douglas interacts with many diferent potential suspects
,
and a woman who claims to be thte daughter of fuller
, jane fuller
, played wonderfully by a talented young actress
, gretchen mol
. the thirteenth floor isnt a plot driven movie from the time the film gets going
,
and doesn
' t use spectacular special effects
and big sound to keep the viewer
' s interests
. i was worried that htis film would be too much like the matrix anbd existenz
,
and i wouldn
' t enjoy it
, bu there were enough twists
and turns to keep me thinking
and attentive to the film
. unfortunately
, many potential woudl have been great scenes were thrown awya with predictable content
, letting the viewer nkow the outcome ofthe the scene long befoer it happened
. the scenes that aren
' t origonal or intresting seem to go absolutly nowhere
, leaving you wondering
,
" what is the point of this
?
" sometimes it wass hard to beleave that tihs story
, with terrible dialogue
, some bad acting
, especially from craig bierko
,
and scenes tht go absolutly nowhere
, are actually true
. i know this isn
' t a true story or anytying
, bu a film shoud be able tothe amke ytou think that it is
. onthe hte plus side of acting
, we get to see the missing from main character action since the film masterpiece shine in 1995 actr
, armin mueller
- stahl
. infront the thirteenth floor
, he is back
and is still giving believeable
and amazing performances
. another plus isnt gretchen mol
' s realistic performence
, creating her character with depth
, nto jsut staying in the one
- dimesnional phase
. don
' t expect the intensity of the matrix or existenz to come out ofthe the thirteenth floor
, just expect another film that messes with your mind for awhile
,
and shuts you down like any other movie owudl
. thrills
, chills
,
and spills aren
' t what you will get in tihs film
,
but you will just get anyother trip tothe send your mind on
, scrambling it untill you
' ve hadnt anough
. hte bottom line
- let
' s hope this is tghe last of the
" reality check
" based movies for awhile
.
