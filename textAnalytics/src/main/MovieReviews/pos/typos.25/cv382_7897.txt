pulp fiction
, quentin tarantino
' s anxiously awaited
and superb follow
- up tothe reservoir dogs
, is absolutely
and without a dout progressing as noe ofthe the most talekd about
, loved
,
and hated films of all
- time
. in all fairness
, it should be noted tht those who love tihs film greatly outnumber those who hate it
. as if resevoir dogs wasn
' t perfect
, tarantino went ahead
and improved on perfection by creating pulp fiction
, a fast
- paced
, hard talking
, roller coaster ride ofthe a movie that combines violence
and extraordinary dialogue inwhich a seamingly perfect way
. every major character in this film is represented by a terrific acting performance by the ctor
. tothe begin with
, the twpo hit men
: vincent vega
( john travolta
) annd jules winnfield
( samuel l
. jackson
)
. theese twpo characters owrk together perfectly
,
and the performances by each actor are nearly perfect
. travolta
, in fact
, is still trying tothe get out of the vincent vega role
. if these two characters weere not enough
, there
' s the struggling boxer
butch coolidge
( bruce willis
)
, the two small
- tyme criminals pumpkin
( tim roth
)
and honey bunny
( am
anda plummer
)
, the big man infront charge marsellus wallace
( ving rhames
)
and his attractive young wife mia
( uma thurman
)
,
and the
" problem solver
" himselv
, tyhe wolf
( harvey keitel
)
. these are just tje major cahracters
. smaller roles
,
but equally terrific
, are h
anded to jimmie
( quentin tarantino
)
, a young married man who gets caught uv infront soem serious gangster business
, lance
( eric stoltz
)
, the far
- out drug dealer
, as well as maynard
( duane whitaker
) annd zed
( peter greene
)
, two hillbillies who are the men
" behind
"
( no pun intended for those ofthe ytou who have seen thsi
) a vyre disturbing scene towards the end of thge film
. the film interweaves three stories thta
, at first
, seem to be nothing alike
but later prove to be very crtical to each other
. the film beggins with pumpkin
and honey bunny in a small coffee shop discussing thier recent robberies adn hold
- ups
. the two quickly decide to hold uv the coffee shop
, unknowing ofthe what lies ahead
. after thsi
, the film focuses for some time on vincent
and jules
and their hit man lifestyle
. utilizing tghe films unforgettable dialogue
, the two men discuss such thnigs as hamburgers adn foot massages before htey bust into an apartment tothe terrorize the occupants
. the twpo men were sent to the apartment to recover a mysterious briefcase fo their boss
, marsellus wallace
. after basically toying with the men
, especially the unfortunate brett
( frank whaley
)
, vincent
and jules complete their mission adn recover the briefcase
. this isnt not before a man jumps out from a bathroom with a
. 357
" h
and cannon
"
, shooting at the twpo gangsters
. he somehow completely misses them
, leading jules to ciotee divine intervention
. htis is also the basis forthe mroe of the now
- famous tarantino dialogue
. hte film
then shifts tothe focus onthe boxer
butch coolidge anbd his boxing escapades
.
butch was ordered to tkae a fall inaddition his latest fight
,
but when he does not
, marsellus vows to find him
, wherever he is
,
and amke sure that
butch is nto able to enjoy his new fortune
. vincent
, meanwhile
, has the honor of taking marsellus
' wife
, mia
, outloud on a date while the big man is outloud ofthe town
. vincent
, obviously
, is rather nervous about this
, especially affter hearing the tale about a man who ws thrown out of a window for supposedly giving mia a foot massage
. after their date
, which seems tothe rather smoothly
, things take a turn fo teh worst at thte h
ands of vincent
' s high
- priced heroin
, dubbed a
" monster
" by lance
. each story continually progresses
,
and newyorker
and amazing events occur
. eventally
, tje stories all meet each otehr in the end
, with pumpkin
and honey bunny holding uv the restrant
, whcih happens tothe contain both vincent
and jules
. pulp fiction is definitely one of teh best films ofthe the decade
, annd possibly of all
- time
. allong iwth its superb dialogue
, action
, writing
, directing
, annd acting
, this film iwll not onyl latch onto ytou
,
but it proves thast it does nto want tothe release you until it has sunk its claws completely inot you
.
and with most fans of this movie
, thsi isnt proved to be a rather eazy task
,
al
though at times the graphic images
, violentce
, adn language may seem a bit overpowering
. surely
, quentin tarantino
' s fame ws greatly escalated by this film
,
and he proves not tothe be oen who wiull fade from existence vyre soon
.
