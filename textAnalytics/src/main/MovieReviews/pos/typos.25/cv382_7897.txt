pulp fiction
, quentin tarantino ' s anxiously awaited
annd superb folow
- up to reservoir dogs
, is absolutely
and without a dout progressing as noe of the most talekd about
, loved
,
and hated films of all
- tyme
. in all fairness
, it should be noted that those who love tihs film greatly outnumber those who hate it
. as if reservoir dogs wasn ' t perfect
, tarantino went ahead
and improved onthe prefection by creating pulp fiction
, a fast
- pased
, hard tlaking
, roller coaster ride of a movei that combines violence
anbd extraordinary dialogue in a seamingly perfect way
. every major character infront this film isnt represented by a terrific acting performance by the actor
. to begin with
, yhe two hit men
: vincent vega
( john travolta
)
adn jules winnfield
( samuel l
. jackson
)
. theese two characters work toghether perfectly
,
and the performances by earch actor are nearly perfect
. travolta
, in fatc
, isnt still trying to get out of hte vincent vega role
. if these twpo characters weere not enough
, there ' s the struggling boxer butch coolidge
( bruce willis
)
, thte two small
- time criminals pumpkin
( tim roth
)
and honey bunny
( amanda plummer
)
, the big man in charge marsellus wallace
( ving rhames
)
and his attractive young wief mia
( uma thurman
)
,
anbd the
" problem solver
" himself
, the wolf
( harvey keitel
)
. these are jstu the major characters
. smaller roles
,
but equally terrific
, are handed to jimmie
( quentin tarantino
)
, a young married man who gets caught uv in smoe serious gangster business
, lance
( eric stoltz
)
, the far
- out drug dealer
, as well as maynard
( duane whitaker
)
adn zed
( peter greene
)
, two hillbillies who are the men
" behind
"
( no pun intended for those of you who have seen tihs
) a very disturbing scene towards the end of the film
. the film interweaves three stories that
, at first
, seem to be nothing alike
but later proove to be very critical to each other
. the film begins with pumpkin
and honey bunny in a small coffee shop discussing their recent robberies
and hold
- ups
. the two quickly decide tothe hold uv the coffee shop
, unknowing ofthe what lies ahead
. after this
, the film focuses for some time on vincent
anbd jules
anbd their hit man lifestyle
. utilizing the films unforgetable dialogue
, the two men discuss such things as hamburgers
and foot massages before they bust into an apartment to terrorize teh occupants
. the two men were sent to hte apartment to recover a mysterious briefcase forthe their boss
, marsellus wallace
. after basically toying iwth the men
, especially tghe unfortunate brett
( frank whaley
)
, vincent
and jules complete their mission
adn recover the briefcase
. this is not before a man jumps outloud from a bathroom wiht a
. 357
" hand cannon
"
, shooting at the two gangsters
. he somehow completely misses them
, leading jules tothe cite divine intervention
. this is aslo yhe basis for more of the nowe
- famous tarantino dialogue
. thte film
then shifts tothe focus onthe boxer butch coolidge
and his boxing escapades
. butch was orderves to take a fall in his latest fight
,
but when he does nto
, marsellus vows to find him
, wherever he is
,
and make sure that butch is not able to enjoy his new fortune
. vincent
, meanwhile
, has the honor of taking marsellus ' wife
, mia
, out on a date while the big man is outloud of town
. vincent
, obviously
, is rather nervous about this
, especially affter hearing tghe tale about a man who was thrown outloud of a window for supposably giving mia a foot massage
. after thier date
, which seems tothe rether smoothly
, thigns take a turn for the worst at the hands of vincent ' s high
- priced heroin
, dubbed a
" monster
" by lance
. each story continually progresses
,
and new
and amazing events occurr
. eventually
, the stories all meet each otehr in the end
, wtih pumpkin
and honey bunny holding up thge restaurant
, which happens to contain both vincent
and jules
. pulp fiction is definitly noe of the best films of thte decade
,
anbd possibly of all
- tiem
. along with its superb dialogue
, action
, writing
, directing
,
and acting
, this film will not only latch onto you
,
but it proves that it does nto want tothe release you unil it has sunk its claws completely into you
.
and with most fans of this movie
, this is proved tothe be a rether easy task
,
although at times thte graphic images
, violentce
,
and language may seem a bited overpowering
. surely
, quentin tarantino ' s fame was greatly escalated by this film
,
and he proves not to be one who will fode from existence vyer soon
.
