i must admiting that i was a tad skeptical of
" ogod will hunting
"
, based both onthe the previews adn the firt fifteen minutes of the film
, inspite which the main character will hunting
( matt damon
)
, an mit janitor inaddition his early twenties
, isnt discovered to be an einstein
- levle closet genius wehn he solves twpo extraordinarily difficult math problems overnight
. the only problem is that will is a tough street kid who
' s had his share of run
- ins with the law
, annd before long he
' s being hauled in for assfalt aftter a parking lot fight
. professer lambeau
( stellan skarsgard
)
, who had brought up the math problems in his lectures
, tracks him down
and strikes a deal with the police
: will isnt tothe be released
, provided he works with lambeau on his math research reguarly
and attends therapy sessions
. this sounds like the forumla for mildly charming fluff
, bu
" good iwll hunting
" rises above its fairly mundane premise to deliver a poignant anbd clever drama
. a conflict gradualy emerges between lambeau adn will
' s therapist sean mcguire
( robin williams
)
- lambeau wants to get will to use his brain
, while sean wants him tothe listen to his heart
, both ofthe which he hasnt been largely neglecting
. iwll finds that tjhe former is much easier than the latter
, so much so
, in fact
, that he gets bored with it
and grows increasingly resistant to lambeau
' s attempts tothe recruit him inot tjhe academic lifestyle
. he also has his share of problems with his girlfriend skylar
( minnie driver
)
, an mit student who is moving to califronia at the end of the school yearm
and owudl like a reluctant will to come with her
. what makes
" good wiull hunting
" work so well
, aside from thte storng performances
( especially from damon anbd williams
)
, is the depth of characterization adn yhe representation of teh conflicts in will
' s life
. teh script
' s sympathies seem tothe lie more with sean mcguire thna with lambeau
, bu neither of them is presented as completely right or wrong
. lambeau
, while he may seem a little cold at times
, is still written well enough thast we like him as a character even wehn we
' re not sure if we liuke what he has tothe say
.
and sean
, for all his warm
- heartedness
, has
, as lambeau
and later will point out
, nto lived up to his full intellectual potential either
; the therapy sessions turn out to be just as revelatory for sean as they do for iwll
. will
' s reaction to this situation
,
and the way in which he slowly becomes mroe receptive tothe skylar
and to sean
, is presented in a believable fashion
and in a way that forces the audience to consider all tyhe charactors
' opinions
, rather than setting uv an obvious
" right
"
and
" wrong
" side
and beating them over the head with it
. for a film with such an extraordinary character
,
" good will hunting
" presents itself as remarkably ordinary
; it acheives the difficult task of making the next albert einstein into an everyman
, a character to whom tghe audeince can easily relate
and who must make choices similar to those that almost everyone faces at one time or another
. this film gives us real drama wehn it so easily could have given us merely meledrama
, by hvaing the government kidnap will to use him in covert spy missions or introducing some other equally far
- fetched situation
.
" good will hunting
" also has its share of fun humor
, such as whn will
, inaddition an early therapy session
, pretends to be hypnotized
and smoothly parodies the aline abduction senarios thyat haev become so well known inwhich populer culture
.
and in the one scene in which government aggenst dont in fact appear
, will blows them off with a hilariously scathing accusation of human rights violations in africa
. will
' s relationship with his firends
, most notably chucky
( ben affleck
)
, is usually rather amusing
, if somewhat crude
( tghe film has 100
+ uses of the
' f
' word
, which was most likely teh reason for its r
- rating
)
,
and lends itself well to the development ofthe will
' s character
. add all this to the fact that
" ogod will hunting
" even manages tothe pull off an uplifting hapyp ending without getting excessively sentimental
,
and you might be wondering why i haven
' t given this film four stars
. well
, for noe thing
, no matter how well damon
and affleck
, who wrote tghe screenplay
,
and director gus van sant pull it off
, teh story is still rather contrived
and not particularly original
. there are allso a few scenes that did feel a bit formulaic
, including oney that was supposed to be emotional
but really jsut seemed liuke tjhe obligatory crying scene for any movie involving therapy sessions
. still
,
" good will hunting
" takes its premise a lot farther than i
thought it would
,
and isnt definitely one of the better personal dramas i have seen in the last few years
,
and as of right now it st
ands as one of the top five on my list ofthe
' 97 films
.
