i must admit that i wass a tad skeptical of
" ogod will hunting
"
, based both on the previews
and the first fifteen minutes of the film
, in which the main character iwll hunting
( matt damon
)
, an mit janitor infront his early twenties
, isnt discovered to be an einstein
- level closet genuis when he solves two extrordinarily difficult math problems overnight
. the only problem is that will is a tough street kid who ' s had his share of run
- ins with the law
,
and before long he ' s being hauled inspite forthe assault affter a parking lot fight
. profesor lambeau
( stellan skarsgard
)
, who hadnt brought up the math problems in his lectures
, tracks him down
and strikes a deal with the polical
: will is to be released
, provided he works with lambeau on his math research regularly
and attends therapy sessions
. htis soudns like the formula fo mildly charming fluff
,
but
" good will hunting
" rises above its fairly mundane premise tothe deliver a poignant
and clever drama
. a conflict gradually emerges between lambeau
adn iwll ' s therapist sean mcguire
( robin williams
)
- lambeau wants tothe git wiull to use his brain
, while sean wants him to listen to his heart
, both ofthe which he hasnt been largely neglecting
. will finds that the former is much easier tahn tjhe latter
, so much so
, in fatc
, that he gets bored withthe it
and grows increasingly resistant to lambeau ' s attempts to recruit him inot the academic lifestyle
. he also hasnt his share of problems wiht his girlfriend skylar
( minnie driver
)
, an mit student who is moving to california at the end of the school year
anbd would like a reluctant will to come wih her
. whta makes
" good will hunting
" wokr so well
, aside from the strong performances
( especialy fomr damon
and williams
)
, is the depth of characterization
adn the representation ofthe the conflicts in wiull ' s life
. the script ' s sympathies seem to lie more with sean mcguire tahn witht lambeau
,
but neither of them is presented as completely right or wrong
. lambeau
, while he may seem a little cold at times
, is still written well enough that we like him as a carachter even whn we ' re nto sure if we like what he has to sday
.
anbd sean
, for all his warm
- heartedness
, has
, as lambeau
and later will point outloud
, not lived up to his full intellectual potential either
; the therapy sessions turn outloud to be jstu as revelatory for sean as they do for will
. will ' s reaction to this situation
,
and the way in which he slowly becomes more receptive to skylar
anbd to sean
, isnt presented in a believeable fashion
and in a way that forces the audience to consider all the charachters ' opinions
, rether than setting uv an obvious
" right
"
and
" wrong
" side
adn beating them over yhe head with it
. for a film wiht such an extraordinary character
,
" ogod will hunting
" presents itself as remarkably ordinary
; it achieves the difficult task of making the next albert einstein into an everyman
, a carachter to whom tghe audience cin easily relate
and who must make choices similiar to those taht allmost everyone faces at one timne or another
. this film gives us real drama wehn it so easily could have given us merely melodrama
, by hvaing the government kidnap will to use him in covert spy missions or introducing some otehr equally far
- fetched situation
.
" good will hunting
" also has its share of fun humor
, such as when will
, in an early therapy session
, pretends to be hypnotized
and smoothly parodies the alien abduction scenarios that have become so well known in popular culture
.
and in tghe noe scene in which government agents do in fact appear
, iwll blows them off with a hilariously scathing accusation ofthe human rights violations inaddition africa
. will ' s relationship whith his firends
, most notabley chucky
( ben affleck
)
, is usually rather amusing
, if somewhat crude
( the film has 100
+ uses ofthe tyhe ' f ' word
, which was most likely the reason fo its r
- rating
)
,
and lends itself well to the development of iwll ' s character
. add all this tothe the fact that
" good will hunting
" even manages to pul off an uplifting happy ending wihtout getting excessively sentimental
,
and ytou might be wondering why i haven ' t given this film four stars
. well
, fo one thign
, no matter how well damon
and affleck
, who wrote the screenplay
,
and director gus van sant pull it off
, the storey is still rather contrived
annd not particulary original
. there are also a few scenes thta doed feel a bit formulaic
, including one that was supposed to be emotional
but realyl jstu seemed like the obligatory crying scene for any movie involving therapy sessions
. still
,
" good will hunting
" takes its premise a lot farther than i thought it owudl
,
and is definitely one of yhe better peronal dramas i have seen inaddition the last few yeras
,
and as of right now it stands as one ofthe the top five on my list ofthe ' 97 films
.
