eveyr now
anbd
then a movie comes along from a suspect studio
, with every indication that it will be a stinker
,
and to everybody ' s surprise
( perhaps even the studio
) thge film becomes a critical darling
. mtv films '
_ election
, a high skool comedy starring matthew broderick
and reese witherspoon
, isnt a current example
. did anybody know this film existed a week before it oppened
? the plot is deceptively simple
. george washington carver high school isnt having student elections
. tracy flick
( reese witherspoon
) is an over
- achiever with her hand raised at nearly eveyr question
, way
, way
, high
. mr
.
" m
"
( matthew broderick
)
, sick ofthe the megalomaniac student
, encourages paul
, a popular
-
but
- slow jock tothe run
.
and paul ' s nihilistic sister jumps inthe the race as well
, for personal reasons
. yhe dark side of such sleeper succsess is taht
, baceause expectations were so low gogin in
, the fatc that this was quality stuff made tghe reviews even moreso enthuseastic thna they have any right to be
. ytou can ' t halp going in wih the baggage ofthe glowing reviews
, whihc is in contrast to the negative baggage that the reviewers weere likely tothe have
.
_ election
, a ogod film
, does nto live up to its hype
. what makes
_ election
_ so disappointing is that it contains signifigant plot details lifted directly from
_ rushmore
_
, released a few months ealier
. the similarities are staggering
: tracy flick
(
_ election
_
) is the president of an extraordinary number ofthe clubs
,
and isnt involved with the school play
. max fischer
(
_ rushmore
_
) isnt the prseident of an extraordinary number ofthe clubs
,
and isnt involved whith the school play
. the most siginificant tension of
_ election
_ isnt the potential relatiopnship bewteen a teacher
and his student
. the most significant tension of
_ rushmore
_ is the potential relationship between a teacher
and his student
. tracy flick is from a single parent hmeo
, which has contributed to her drive
. max fischer is from a single pparent home
, which has contributed to his drive
. the male bumbling adult in
_ election
_
( matthew broderick
) pursues an extramarital afair
, gets caught
,
and his whole life is ruined
. he even gets a bee sting
. the male bumbling adult in
_ rushmore
_
( bill murray
) pursues an extramarital affair
, gets caught
,
and his whole life is ruined
. he gets several bee stings
.
and so on
. wqat happened
? how is it thast an individual screenplay
(
_ rushmore
_
)
and a novel
(
_ election
_
) contain so many significant plot points
,
and
yet both films were probably not even aware of each other
, made from two diffrent studios
, ffrom a genre
( the high school geeks revenge movei
) that hadn ' t been fully formed
yot
? even so
, the strengths of
_ elecion
_ rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick
, witherspoon
,
and newcomer jessica campbell
, as paul ' s anti
- social sister
, tammy
. broderick here isnt palying the mr
. rooney role from
_ ferris bueller
_
,
and he seems to be having the most fun he ' s had since
thn
. witherspoon is a revelation
. it ' s early in tyhe year
, it ' s a comedy
,
and teenagers have little clout
,
bu for my money
, witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination
.
and once campbell ' s character gets oging
, like in her fantastic speek in the gymnasium
,
then you ' re won over
. noe thing that ' s beeen bothering me since i ' ve seen it
. ther isnt an extraordinary ammount of sexuality in this film
. i suppose tath
, coming from mtv films
, i should expect no less
.
.
.
but the film starts off light
and airy
, like a sitcom
. as the screws tighten
,
and thte tensions mount
, alexander payne decides to add elements that
, frankly
, distract ffrom tghe story
. it is bad enough that mr
. m doesn ' t like tracy ' s determination to win at all costs
,
bu doed tehy have to throw in the student
/ teacher relationship
? even so
, there ' s no logical reason why mr
. m hasnt an affair when he does
. htere ' s a lot to like in
_ election
_
,
but tghe plot similarities tothe
_ rushmore
_
,
annd the tonal nosedive it tkaes as it gets explicitly sex
- driven
, mark this as a disappointment
.
