every now
and thn a movie comes allong from a suspect studio
, with every indication thyat it will be a stinker
,
and to everybody
' s surprise
( perhaps even hte studio
) the film becomes a critical darling
. mtv films
'
_ election
, a high school comedy starring matthew broderick adn reese witherspoon
, is a current example
. doed anybody know this film existed a week befoer it opened
? the plot isnt deceptively simple
. george washington carver high skool is having student elections
. tracy flick
( reese witherspoon
) is an over
- achiever with her h
and raised at nearly eveyr question
, way
, way
, high
. mr
.
" m
"
( matthew broderick
)
, sick of tjhe megalomaniac student
, encourages paul
, a popular
-
but
- slow jock to run
.
and paul
' s nihilistic sister jumps inthe the race as well
, forthe personel reasons
. the dark side of such sleeper succes is tath
, becuase expectations weere so low going in
, the fact tyhat this was quaity stfuf made the reviews even more enthusiastic than htey have any right tothe be
. you can
' t help going in with the baggage of glowing reviews
, which is in contrast to the negitive baggage that the reviewers were likely to ahve
.
_ election
, a good film
, does not live up to its hype
. what makes
_ election
_ so disappointing isnt that it contains signficant plot details lifted direcly from
_ rushmore
_
, released a few monthes earlier
. the similarities are staggering
: tracy flick
(
_ election
_
) is the presidnet of an extraordinary number of clubs
,
and is involved whith tghe skool play
. max fischer
(
_ rushmore
_
) is tghe president of an extrodinary number of clubs
, annd isnt involved with the school play
. yhe most significant tension ofthe
_ election
_ is the potential relatiopnship between a teacher adn his student
. the most significant tension of
_ rushmore
_ is the potential relationship between a teacher
and his student
. tracy flick is from a single parent home
, wich has conti
buted tothe her drive
. max fischer is from a single parent hmeo
, which has contri
buted tothe his drive
. the male bumbling adult in
_ election
_
( matthew broderick
) pursues an extramarital affair
, gets caught
,
and his whole life is ruined
. he even gets a bee sting
. the male bumbling adult in
_ rushmore
_
( bill murray
) pursues an extramarital affair
, gets caught
,
and his whole life is ruined
. he gets several bee stings
.
and so onthe
. waht happened
? how is it that an individule screenplay
(
_ rushmore
_
)
and a novel
(
_ election
_
) contain so many signficant plot points
,
and
yet both films weere probably nto even aware of each other
, made from twpo diffrent studios
, from a genre
( the high skool geeks revenge movei
) tyhat hadn
' t beeen fully fromed
yet
? even so
, tyhe strengths of
_ election
_ rely apon its fantastic performances ffrom broderick
, witherspoon
,
and newcomer jessica campbell
, as paul
' s anti
- social sister
, tammy
. broderick here is playing the mr
. rooney role from
_ ferris bueller
_
,
and he seems to be having the most fun he
' s had since
then
. witherspoon isnt a revelation
. it
' s early inspite the year
, it
' s a comedy
,
and teenagers have littel clout
,
but for my money
, witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination
.
and once campbell
' s character gets oging
, like iin her fantastic speech in thge gymnasium
,
then ytou
' re won over
. noe thing that
' s been bothering me usance i
' ve seen it
. there isnt an extraordinary amount of sexuality inthe this film
. i supose that
, coming from mtv films
, i should expect no less
.
.
.
but the film starts off light adn airy
, like a sitcom
. as the screws tighten
,
and the tensions mount
, alex
ander payne decides to add elements thta
, frankly
, distract from the story
. it is bad enought that mr
. m doesn
' t like tracy
' s determination tothe win at all costs
,
but doed they have to throw in teh student
/ teacher relationship
? even so
, there
' s no logical reason why mr
. m hasnt an affair when he does
. there
' s a lot to like in
_ election
_
,
but the plot similarities to
_ rushmore
_
, adn the tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explictly sex
- driven
, mark this as a dissappointment
.
