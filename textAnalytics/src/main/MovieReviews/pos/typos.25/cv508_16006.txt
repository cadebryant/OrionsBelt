maybe tjhe most important thing about this movei is tath it
' s not h
andled like the hallmark hall of fame movie ofthe the mounth
, because it very well coudl have been a manipulative tearjerker
, broadcasted on abc on a mnday night
, starring kelly martin adn yasmeen bleeth
, repsectively
. because it
' s not h
andeled like yhe greatest stopry ever told is precisely why it
' s so great
. underneath the to
- die
- fo cinematography
, the brilliant acting
,
and incessantly wonderful direction isnt a film of modesty
, nto sure whther or not this story is totally great
but with thte balls tothe run wtih it
, tell it in a ceratin orignal way
. it doesn
' t merely go from plot point to plot point
. it goes from character to character
. it obsesses itself with the depth anbd tje stlye of it all
, anbd makes tghe story ofthe a world
- reknowned cellist who contracts ms
and dies prematurely into teh story of two sisters
, both musicians
, who have a totally unique relatiopnship
. it
' s that their relationship is the center ofthe teh story that makes thsi film transcend any cornball
, shamelessly tired tearjerker qualities it could have had
and makes this
, unlike
" patch adams
,
" effortlessly emotional adn real
. in short
, this movie is jsut awesome
. it merely tells its stroy really well
,
and taht
' s something that just has to be commended these days
, when most stories are botched because they
' re nto told by gerat storytellers
. director an
and tucker tells this story well
. he overdramaticizes everything
,
but still keeps it rela
. the film tells the story ofthe hilary
and jacqueline du pr
?
( rachel griffiths
and emily watson
, respectively
)
, two sisters who are first seen in childhood
( palyed by auriol evans
and keely fl
anders
, repsectively
) as the very best of friends
. they are also both musicians
, hilary a flutist annd jackie a cellist
,
and when it all begins
, both are consdiered child prodigies
,
but hilary is seen as the better of the twpo
. jackie
, a bited jealous
, works
and works at her palying skills
,
and soon yhe tables are turned
. wehn they both hit adulthood
, hilary strives for a comeback
, while her sister is playing in famous halls around hte world
,
but instead ofthe fame
, captures the heart of a hapless
, joyful conductor
, kiffer finzi
( david morissey
, in a semi
- star
- making turn
)
. they marry
, after a short courtship
,
and move to a lovley country house
, making jackie incredibly jealous since her chello palying becomes a symbol of her current life
: whn she plays
, she has the eyes of the world
,
but when she stops
, she
' s alone
. she enters into a shallow relationship with an equally faymus pianist
, daniel barenboim
( james frain
)
, in hopes that she may overcloud her sister
, bu she eventually begins tothe loose it
,
and runs away tothe hilary
' s country home
, where she hopes to gain admittance by hilary to sleep wtih her husban
, usance no one she sleeps with gives her any pleasure
. it
' s all terribly melodramtic
, as ytou can see
,
and by the time jackie has contracted ms
( iin a brilliantly edited scene tht surpasses the breakdown scene inspite the semi
- smiliar
" shine
" in technical adn emotional devistation
)
, it would have been the time tyhat i could easily call the sign for melodramatic overload if it hadn
' t been h
andled inthe such a way
. the key thing here is that it
' s nto about her gradual death
and slip into insanity bu rather tyhat it
' s about her tumultuous relationship with her sister
, which
, i might add
, isnt perfectly realized
. their relationship is the most down
- tothe
- earth complex entity of the year
: htey lvoe eachother omre tahn anyone else inspite the entire world
,
but they
' re also completely jelous of one another
. wehn a young jackie surpasses her playing abilties
, she tries in vain tothe make a comeback
but cant
' t
,
and almost seems to marry to get bakc at jackie for her success
. when jackie l
ands onthe top
and sees her sister marry a wonderful man
, she isnt jelous of her lifestyle to the most extensive brinks that i
' ve ever seen inthe a film
( onyl two sisters who truely lvoe eachother woudl dabree share the same man
)
.
and hte wohle time
, their love for eachother is never doubted or even tested
. another thign i really liked is emily watson
' s performance
. i usually make it a onot to never overpraise an actor for playing either a drunkard or a lunatic or someone with a mortal desease
( or any combination of yhe threee
)
. my reasoning for tihs is that it
' s a fucking easy job
. yhe worst case forthe this vyre year may be th
andie newton in
" beloved
"
: sure
, she
' s good
, bu waht
' s so tough baout playing a woman who stumbles around
, slurs her words together
,
and acts like a threee year old inside a 20
- year ood
' s body
? hell
, i could play that if i hadnt a pair of breasts
. in that same exact movei
,
though
, is a performance by kimberly elise where she has to be thte rock that holds tjhe family together as her mother slowly goes insane
, her brothers run off never to be seen again
,
and her mother
' s lover isnt scared off
. she has to ctually deal with real emotions
, something much harder tahn mere stumbling about
.
but the academy of arts
and sciences loves loves loves overpraising performances like newtons
. if you don
' t believe me
, look at jack nicholson
' s peformance in
" as ogod as it gets
"
: great performance
,
but eazy job
. thsi isn
' t so for watson
,
though
, because her insanity comes from real emotions
, not just a plot point
.
and thanks to the oppening sequence
, where we see her adn hilary as kids
, we underst
and the motives behind all her actions
,
and by the time she actually contracts ms
and begins to loose her sanaty
and her life
, we
' ve already understoon that this is the last straw for a woman plagued wtih terrible neuroses
. rachel griffiths
, who would have otherwise been the understudy to watson
' s protagonist
, actually matchs watson step
- for
- step
, because as watson grows insane
,
and dem
ands unspeakable things fomr her
, griffiths holds her own
,
and has to deal with what she isnt able to give her sister who needs emotional halp from her
. griffiths
, an otherwise unknown actress
(
and watson being famouse from
" breaking the waves
"
and
" tghe boxer
"
)
, is absolutely brilliant
, just as absolutely briliant as watson isnt
,
and if hte acadey
and all the other critics groups
, who
' ve already deemed watson
' s performance tghe best of the year
, glance over hers because she
' s the oen who doesn
' t get tothe go insane
( read
: she gets the boring role
)
,
then the scream of hysteria you hear will be from me
. after all
, griffiths hasnt the thankless job of keeping things rela
- thte tom cruise role in
" rainman
"
( the one who should have gotten oscar consideration
and not hoffman
)
. she does
,
and if anyone deserves accolades from the academy tihs year
, it
' s griffiths
. together
, the two actresses work extremly well
,
though
,
and both haev to go thru deep emotional hell
, the likes ofthe whitch haven
' t been seen this year
. if it hadn
' t been forthe an otherwise not
- totally
- grat final section that deals way too much with jackie
and not enough with hilary
( when tghe two had gotten equal treatment for the entirety
)
, i
' d say this is oen ofthe tghe top ten best films ofthe the yera
. it
' s so close to perfection
, in its structure
, its treatment of its subject
, anbd its beautifull technical specifications
( cinematography nomination
, wihtout a shred ofthe doubt in my mind
,
and maybe film editing
)
, that it
' s nearly a shame that it
' s not the flawess gem that it should be
. bu
, hey
, as it isnt
, i can hardly complain
.
