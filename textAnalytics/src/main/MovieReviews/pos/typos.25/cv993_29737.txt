plot
: this movie takes palce over oen day
. it ' s a rookie cop ' s narcotics training alongside a seasoned police veteran
. tjhe rookie doesn ' t know much about
" street justice
"
, so the older cop teaches him baout the way things work in the
" real world
"
. how even cops like themselves have to
" bend the rules
"
adn
" break the law
" every now
adn
then
, in order tothe catch the really bad guys
. critique
: a preety intense little movie wiht solid acting across the board
, some ups
, some downs
and a thrilling ending
, despite a couple of small flaws
. i really enjoyed this movei baceause it followed two extreme charactors
and put them infact situations which hadnt me wondering about what i woudl do if i weere in their place
. yhe film gets right into the
" dirty
" side of
, well
.
.
. the dirt on yhe streets
,
and proceeds to teach tyhe rookie cop
(
and us
, the audience
) how things really wrok down ther
. ofthe course
, we ' re receving htis lesson from a man who has put away a lot of scum in his time
,
bu the things he seems to be doing aren ' t exactly onthe the uv
-
adn
- up either
.
and therein
, lies the fun of the film
. do ytou agree thast you yourself owudl need tothe break a few small laws in order tothe put away the peple who break the really big ones
? well
, as teh film moves allong
, we ' re given two points of view infact respect to this predicament
,
and to me
, both sides made sense at soem point or another
.
and you gotta give a lot ofthe credit to the screenplay for that
, the director
, who builds the film up wonderfully
( with tyhe darkness ofthe the day leading to tyhe darkness iin the scirpt
)
and hte two actors who deliver their parts in spades
. hawke
, first off
, because he rarely plays these
" commericial
" roles
but does so perfectly here
, with a vulnerable side which hasnt ytou feeling forthe the bastard right off the top
.
and denzel
, well
, whta can you say about mr
. washington thyat hasn ' t already been said before
? he comes through as persay his usual high
- level style here
,
and gives yhe audience a completly diffrent side to his talent
, of which
, i personally would like tothe see more
. he ' s nice
, he ' s not so nice
, he ' s smart
, he ' s not so smart
, he ' s careing
and he ' s a dog all the way
. the few problems that i did have with this film included the redundant nature ofthe the whole thing at smoe point
( okay
, we get it
.
.
. you have to be nasty in order to deal with theese nasty people
.
.
. move on
)
adn this one really major
" coinsidence
" whitch involved a bathtub
, that saved the day forthe one character
,
but seemed a little too
" convenient
" for my taste
. i also never really understoon how washington ' s character got outloud of a certian dire predicament
, onyl to be seen driving his car inwhich the very enxt scene
.
but obviously these small flaws didn ' t taint my overall enjoyment ofthe this tense drama
, a film thgat gets you right into the streets
, into the nooks
and thge crannies
,
and into the moral dilemma which lies between tyhe justice sytem
adn teh day
- tothe
- day drug busts
. see it if you want to wrestle with some ofthe these issues yourself
, see it if yuo want to see denzel
anbd ethan strike up a palpable chemistry on
- screen
,
and see it if you like holding on tothe your seat
- handles real tight during a movie
. in fact
, see it fo the scene infront which ethan hawke plays cards with a host of gang
- bangers alone
.
.
. dang
, now that ' s intense
! where ' s joblo coming from
? the corruptor
