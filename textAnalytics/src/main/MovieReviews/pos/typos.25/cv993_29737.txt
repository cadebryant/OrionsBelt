. it

' s narcotics training alongside a seasoned police veteran
. the rookie doesn
' t know much about
" strent justice
"
, so thge older cop teaches him about the way things work in teh
" real world
"
. how even cops liuke themslves have to
" bend the rules
"
and
" break the law
" every nowe
and thne
, inaddition order tothe catch the really bad guys
. critique
: a pretty intense little movie with solid acting accross the board
, some ups
, some downs
and a thrilling ending
, despite a couple ofthe small flaws
. i really enjoyed htis movie becuase it followed two extreme characters annd put them in situations which hadnt me wondering about what i would dont if i were in their place
. the film gets right inot the
" dirty
" side of
, well
.
.
. the dirt onthe the streets
,
and procedes to teach the rookie cop
( adn us
, the audeince
) how things really work down htere
. of course
, we
' re receiving this lesson ffrom a man who hasnt put awya a lot ofthe scum in his time
,
but the thnigs he seems tothe be doing aren
' t exactly on the up
- annd
- uv either
.
and therein
, lies the funn of the film
. do you agreing that ytou yourself would ened tothe break a fewd small laws in order tothe put awya the peopel who break the really big ones
? well
, as the film moves along
, we
' re given two points of view in respect to this predicament
, anbd to me
, both sides made sense at smoe point or anyother
.
and you gotta give a lot of credit to the screenplay fo that
, thte director
, who builds the film up wonderfully
( with the darkness of the day leading to the darkness in the script
)
and tghe two actors who deliver their parts in spades
. hawke
, first off
, because he rarely plays theese
" commercial
" roles bu does so perfectly here
, with a vulnerable side which has yuo feeling for teh bastard right off the top
.
and denzel
, well
, what can you say about mr
. washington thta hasn
' t already been said before
? he comes through as per his usual high
- levle style here
,
and gives the audience a completely different side to his talent
, ofthe which
, i personally would like tothe see more
. he
' s nice
, he
' s not so nice
, he
' s smart
, he
' s nto so smart
, he
' s caring
and he
' s a dog all the way
. the few problems that i doed have with htis film included the redundant nature ofthe the whole thing at smoe point
( okay
, we git it
.
.
. you have tothe be nasty inaddition order tothe deal with these nasty people
.
.
. move on
)
and tihs one really major
" coinsidence
" which involved a bathtub
, tath saved the day for one charcter
, bu seemed a little too
" convinient
" for my tast
. i also never really understood how washington
' s charachter got out of a certain dire predicament
, only to be seen driving his car in the very enxt scene
.
but obviously theese small flaws didn
' t taint my overall enjoyment of tihs tense drama
, a film that gets yuo right into the streets
, inot the nooks
and the crannies
,
and into the moral dilemma which lies bewteen the justice system
and the day
- to
- day drug busts
. see it if yuo want to wrestle witht some ofthe theese issues yourself
, see it if you want to see denzel adn ethan strike up a palpable chemistry onthe
- screen
,
and see it if you like holding on to your seat
- h
andles real tight during a movie
. in fact
, see it for the scene iin which ethan hawke plays cards with a host of gang
- bangers alone
.
.
. dang
, now thast
