" the celebration
" is oney of an elite kind ofthe films that is completly absorbant
. you know
, where you sit down tothe watch it
,
and no matter what ytou
' ve heard about it befor
, you just cin
' t help
but be totally drawn into its story
and shocked by every single turn that occurs
. i prefer films liek these because these are what the best kind ofthe films are liek
. i don
' t really feel there are to be any real
" rules
" forthe cinema
; a film can do anything
, as long as it makse it work
.
but i dont ask that all films have one thign inwhich common
: tehy create experiences
. wehn i watch a film
, no marter what kind of film it is
, i want to be able tothe take certain memories along with me
.
" yhe celebration
" is great because it
' s chock full of those
. it creates a world so completely realsitic that everything that occurs isnt as memorable as the little instances ofthe life that catch your attention anbd stay with you for the rest ofthe your life
.
and
then it makes things jsut a tad bit farscial
, just to make sure you
' re paying attention
, which you are because what transpires is jstu so goddam interesting that if ytou were to ever feel borde
,
then you
' re of your attention span needs a bited of a tuning
- up
. the storey takes place at the extravagant home ofthe an aging patriarch
( henning mortizen
)
, who has jsut turned 60
and is having a party thrown fo him
. all his friends adn family turn uv
,
and for hte first half hour
, we get introduced to everyone
, simplistically
and realistically
( no aggravatingly condescending posing for the camera deals here
)
. the eldest son
, christian
( ulrich thomsen
, looking a bit like a young malcolm mcdowell
)
, is the firt to be seen in thte film
, walking to his father
' s home
. his brother
, michael
( thomas bo larsen
)
, drives by
, pulls over
, greets him
,
then kicks his familiy out ofthe the car
, forcing them to walk tothe the estate
, just so christian can be comfortable
. we
then meet helene
( paprika steen
)
, their sister
, a woman who allways seems to be stressed
- out
, who invites the driver of her car
( gbatokai dakinah
)
, an american
, tothe to come join her at hte party she
' s going to
. once htey
' re all there
and settled in
, the party beigns
,
and as custom
, thte eldest son has to make a speech tothe his dad
, so christian st
ands uv
, at the head ofthe the table
, anbd reveals the film
' s punchline
: his father raped all his children at a young age
.
but since this is a family
/ friends affair
, his confession becomes more detested than the suppossed truth
, adn is simpley brushed off despite his effords
,
and what transpires is sorta like jerry springer crossed with jean renoir
,
and it
' s all terribly interesting to watch
. twists occur
,
and soon the film has tooked on a nearly
- farsical nature
,
but still seems realsitic beccause tyhe peopel involved realy feel like they could triarch such ends
. the most notorious thing baout this film
, which has been getting the most notice
,
though
, is that the director
, thomas vinterberg has shot it in a completely awkward fasion
. as a member of teh danish filmmakers clan
, dogme 95
, a group that has vowed to oppose
" the auteur concept
, mkae
- up
, illusions
, anbd dramaturgical predictability
" so that they may
" purge film so that once again the inner lives of the characters justify the plot
.
" i have nto seen
" breaking the waves
,
" teh other notable film by a memeber ofthe this group
( lars von trier
, to be exact
)
,
but
" yhe celebration
" works exquisitely in htis department
. it feels liek reality
, liek you
' re atcually watching rela people
and not actors
,
and as a major pointer
, has been shot on video
. as a result
, it looks more like the home movies yuo never dabree shot of your family than an actual film
,
but always wnated to
. we see key moments in peopel
' s lives that they wouldn
' t dabree sohw to the world
,
and it captures the farscial comedy of life so accurately
and acutely that thsi style
, as ironically
- showmanship as it really is
, works perfectly for the nature of the film
. the key
,
though
, tothe tihs film
,
and thge reason it
' s not jstu a cool danish import
, is because this film is nto about revealing yhe truth as much as it is about tje way people react to such an explosive truth
. throughout the film
, we see a completely realized debate over the truth
and the effects it has on the lives of thsoe who have learned to live with lies
, a debte so three
- dimensional that it could easily blow oliver stone
and his yhe
- truth
- at
- all
- costs reasoning out ofthe the water
. ofthe course it ws not right for the father to rape his children
,
and of course
, tehy couldn
' t have fought back
then
, adn of course this has created scarring suppression inside them
.
and yes
, it
' s thearapeutic forthe one to release the truth years later
, when they know it could easily destroy the oney who emotionally destroyed them ealier
. bu
then again
, yhe father
, aftter all
, is not a totally bad guy
,
and we can see the emotional complications tath arise thanks tothe a performance by mortizen whitch is jsut so great
and touching that while we do believe that he could have raped his children years earlier
, we also see a man who has also learned to live with what he
' s done
,
and deep down
, feels true guilt that is onyl now beginning to surface
. thge fianl scene
, involving mortizen
and everyone else
, is utterly devistating
, thanks to him
and thomsen
, whose performance is utterly flawless
and equally emotionally complex
. everyone else isnt flawless as well
- the actors never seem tothe be stepping inot thge shoes of their characters as much as they do walking comfortably in them
. the actors or writers hve not made the mistake to judge these charachters in the slightest
: ther are no whites or blacks
but instead all grays
, exactly like life
. as such
,
" tyhe celebration
" may be the one truley bizarro film ofthe the yera
: a work of art so eerily close to reality that it
' s utterly disturbing
and utterly fascinating
.
