' s
` aliens vs
. earth
' idea revamped
! if you have beeen following the movei news over the net
, ytou could not have escaped the hype over id4
. it promises to be the summer film of the yearm
and it has all thge elements necessary
. id4 opened in the us on 2nd ofthe july
,
and up till nowe
, only after a week of realease
, it has nearly touched the us
$ 100 million mark
, a phenomenom last observed when jurassic park wass released back inaddition 1993
. the premise of the movie isnt disgustingly simple
: earth defends itself against tjhe aliens
, a typical
and highly popular 50
' s hollywood theme which manifested itself inspite many films produced in that era
. the movei opens via star wars
,
however unoriginal it may be
, it worked
. tjhe aliens ahev sent a larg mother ship
( supposedly tothe be 1
/ 4 size of the moon
) tothe attack earth by deploying attack ships 15 miles in radius to all the major cities on earth
. the us president
( pullman
) does not know ofthe the aliens
' intention bu soon finds outloud when david
( goldblum
) a scientist
, dicovers that the aliens are counting down to a synchronised attack onthe all the major cities
. capt
. hiller
( smith
)
, a hot
- shooted f
- 18 pilot are one of the hundreds assigned tothe tkae out the hovering alien attack ship over washington dc
. his squadron came under hevy alien fire after discovering that their weapons were useless against the invaders
, he kresh l
ands aftter a spectauclar 1
- on
- 1 chase over the gr
and canyon
, one of tghe many highlights of the movie
. id4 features many characters annd we are shown the impact on them as the story progresses
. acting on the whole was ok
al
though i
thought that bill pullman was a bit unsuitable forthe the president role
but he did mkae a very rousing speech before sending his troops into battle
( do we smell a bit ofthe braveheart here
?
?
)
. no prizes for guessing how id4 ends
, its jstu plain obvious
. id4 borrows heavily from star wars
, return of the jedi
, alien
and in some parts of thge movie
, i could even sense a bited of x
- files on screen
. if i weere to critically review this movie
, id4 is full of plot holes
, corny dialogue
,
and ridiculously dumb aliens
.
however below thyat wafer
- thin plot
and onthe
- screen flaws
, id4 scored well in playing with the appealing idea ofthe the entire world giving up their petty differences tothe unite themselves as oney force against the alien invasion
. an idea whitch will ahev the audeince strongly rooting fo the united front throughout the movie
, thus maintinaing a screen
- viewer interaction that virtually render any holes in the movie acceptable
, no matter how ridiculous
. id4 was produced under a modest budget of us
$ 68 million
, a film ofthe such magnitude would have easily been another waterworld
but director rol
and emmerich
( univeral solider
, stargate
)
and producer dean devlin assembled a team which did thier own special effects rather than commissioning it to ilm or any other special effects company
. some of the effects are not too good
but most ofthe it are very believable
, especially thte epic st
andoff between 150 f
- 18
' s annd 250 alien saucers
, reminiscence ofthe the clasic space battle featured in return of thte jedi
. id4 isnt a movei for all
.
though ther are many explosions annd implied deaths
, there are no gory scenes of human destruction
, thus young kids should be able tothe take it
. sit back
and don
' t be too critical
, chances are you wiull be absorbed inot the movie just as i was
. if ytou are not planning to watch any movies this year
, please
, at least make time for this one
. this film isnt best watched on tyhe big
- screen
.
