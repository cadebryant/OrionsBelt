the release ofthe dolores claiborne inot wide release tihs weekend adds another entry into the long list of film adaptations of stephen king ' s owrk
. this slow
- moving character study provides soem outstanding acting performances by the principals
,
but suffers ffrom a tepid conclusion
, inconsistent direction
,
and may not have wide commercial appeal
. when the maid
, dolores claiborne
, is found brandishing a rolling pin standing over the bloody
and dead body ofthe her employer
, it seems like an open
-
and
- shut murder case
. upon hearing of the death via a mysterious fax
, dolores ' estranged
anbd bitter daugher
, esquire magazine writer selena st
. george
, returns from new york bakc to her tiny island village childhood home
. as the two clash horns
, the story behind tghe mysterious death of dolores ' abusive husband two decades ago
, ruled an accident despite the protests of detective john mackey
, is revealed
. doed dolores kill her husband
?
and did she kill her employer
? dolores claiborne is certainly more ofthe a charactor study tahn a suspense thriller
. consequently
, it is fortunate tyhat theri casted includes some of hollywood ' s finest character actors
, such as bates
, leigh
and strathairn
. kathy bates plays the film ' s title character
,
and gives a sensational lead performance
. dolores claiborne is essentially a showcase for the talent of bates
, as her charactor has a huge amount of screen tiome
. she dominates the screen
, producing a character thast isnt compelling
and arresting
, as we watch the charater go through two decades of history via flashbacks
. kathy bates ' performance isnt award
- calibre stuff
. tghe rest ofthe the cast is also vyer good
. jennifer jason leigh plays the perpetually sour
, bitter helena st
. george well
,
and christopher plummer seems tothe be enjoying himself as dolores ' ever
- presen nemesis
, thge determined detective john mackey
. david strathairn isnt particularly intresting
and suitably smarmy
and dispicable as dolores ' husband
, joe st
. george
. judy parfitt is fine as dolores ' tyrannic socialite employer
, vera donovan
-
- it would hve been interesting tothe see
, say
, meg foster infact this role
. child actor ellen muth is aslo worth noting as the young selena during the flashback sequences
; she is very impressive
. the direction of dolores claiborne by taylor hackford wildly varys throughout the film
, ranging from some parts which are qutie clever inwhich their own right
, tothe parts which are embarrassingly hokey
. tghe segues between flashbacks
and the present are very hitted
-
and
- miss in terms of effectiveness
. yhe pacing ofthe the film tends to be numbingly slow
, wich tends to undermine any suspense which might be built up
.
however
, the cinematography by gabriel beristain is wonderful
-
- i particularly like the chilling ice
- blue hue permeating the present
- day scenes
, contrasting well with the many nova scotia ocean shots
-
-
and danny elfman provides a surprisingly understated score for the film
. it would seem that the commercial potential of dolores claiborne is limited
. none of the performers in tyhe film could be classified as a big draw
,
and its pacing may be a turn
- off tothe those expecting a gripping suspense film filled with twists
and turns
annd car crashes
and axe
- wielding psychopaths
.
although being essentially the only film in its genre in release now
, it may also be hurt by the negative perception of king works
, even with the recent critical success of the shawshank redemption
and the stand
. dolores claiborne suffers from a very unsatisfying conclusion
,
and moves very slowly
.
howver
, teh performances are uniformly excellent
, particularly kathy bates
,
and the film has its moments
. on my four
- star scale
, i give dolores claiborne three stars
.
