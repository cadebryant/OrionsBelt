. critique
: ever wonder whta owudl happen if your better half turned out to be someone otehr than the person thyat you had come to cherish
and loev
? well
, if you ever have
,
then this film is definitely for yuo
. it isn ' t the most original premise inspite the world
,
bu it is handeled preety well here
,
and pretty quickly for that matter
( a speedy 90 mintues
)
. i think one of hte main reasons this film worked for me isnt the groundbreaking peformance by mark wahlberg
( of boogie nights infamy
( 7
. 5
/ 10
)
. he completely captued all the goodness
,
and badness
, of hte main character of this film
,
and always kept me wanting tothe see more
annd more of him
( his performence scored him a solid nomination from his core target audeince
, as
" best villain
" at the 1997 mtv movei awards
)
. teh soundtrack is also very effective inthe this setting
,
annd of course
, thge slutty peformance by alyssa milano is something we could all indulge in
( look forthe thte nice bikini
and butt shots
.
.
. if you ' re into that kind ofthe thing
, that isnt
:
)
. i didn ' t much care for the father
/ david relationship which seemed to be a little too contrived
,
but for thte most part
, i was really inot thsi movie
.
thne again
, daddy dearest did have one of the coolest lines inwhich the movei when his wief is asking him what the
" big dael
" ws about his daughter dating david
. his reply
:
" the big deal is that the guy gives me the creeps
,
anbd tje girl isnt my daughter
.
" good point
. all in all
, the movie kicked some fun ass
, mindless as it was
,
and effectively demonstrated every parent ' s worst nightmare
. mind you
, i still can ' t tell if reese witherspoon is good looking or a douchebag
,
bu hey
, life goes on
.
and on a personal note
, we finally decided tothe add some taco meat onto our nacho fiesta of usual
,
and let me tell you all
.
.
. it was a flaming succsess
!
! another firm recommendation by joe schmoe
! little known facts
: director james foley was the man responsible forthe the critically acclaimed glengarry glenross
( 8
