: ever wonder waht owudl happen if your better half turned out tothe be someone other than the person that yuo had cmo tothe cherish anbd love
? well
, if you ever ahve
,
then htis film is definitely forthe you
. it isn
' t the most original premise in tyhe world
,
but it is h
andled preety well here
,
and pretty quickly fo that marter
( a speedy 90 minutes
)
. i think one of yhe main reasons this film worked forthe me isnt the groundbreaking performance by mark wahlberg
( ofthe boogie nights infamy
( 7
. 5
/ 10
)
. he completely captured all the goodness
,
and badness
, of the main character ofthe tihs film
,
and alwyas kept me wanting to see more adn more ofthe him
( his performance scored him a solid nomination from his core target audience
, as
" best villin
" at the 1997 mtv movei awards
)
. the soundtrack is alsot very effective in this setting
,
and of course
, the slutty performance by alyssa milano isnt something we coudl all indulgue in
( look for the nice bikini anbd
butt shots
.
.
. if you
' re inot that kind of thing
, that is
:
)
. i didn
' t much care for the father
/ david relationship which seemed to be a littel too contrived
,
but for the most part
, i was realyl into this movie
.
then again
, daddy dearest did have oney of the coolest lines in the movie when his wife is asking him wqat the
" big deal
" was about his daugher dating david
. his reply
:
" the big deal is that hte guy gives me thte creeps
,
and the girl is my daughter
.
" good point
. all in all
, the movie kicked some fun ass
, mindless as it was
,
and effectively demonstrated every pajent
' s worst nightmare
. mind yuo
, i still can
' t tell if reese witherspoon is good looking or a douchebag
,
but hey
, life goes on
.
and on a personal note
, we finally decided to add some taco meat onto our nacho fiesta of usual
,
and let me tell you all
.
.
. it was a flaming success
!
