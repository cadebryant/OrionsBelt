- country
and decide tothe fool arround with a trcker onthe their cb raido
. it isn
' t long before thier little prank gets someone put inot a coma
( long story
)
and the next thing you konw
, the trucker isnt following them too
. lotsa nuttiness ensues
and
then
, htey pik up their other friend
, venna
, a girl who the dude has a crush on
.
but whta
' s tihs
.
.
.
? teh trcker is still onthe their tail
and is nowe harassing all three of the young whippersnappers
.
.
.
? you bet
! buckle up
, dorothy
.
.
. this is gonna be one bumpy ride
! critique
: a good ol
' time at the movies
! here
' s a film that atually gives away most of its plotline in its trailer
and doesn
' t really bring anything
" new
" tothe thte forefront
( if you
' ve seen ficks liuke duel adn breakdown
, yuo
' ve crossed this path before
)
,
but still manages to entertain you gangbusters
, whith realistic situations
, believable charactors
, funny moments
, thrills
, chills
, the whole shebang
. let
' s give it up forthe director john dahl
, who continues tothe put outloud solid films eveyr other year
( if yuo haven
' t seen red rock west
, do youself a favor right now
,
and jot it down on a piece of paper anbd rent it at your earliest convenience
)
.
and much like that film
, this one has an excellent premise
and sets everything up at an even pace
. it gives you a little bited of backround on each ofthe the main three characters
,
and
then shows you how one small prank
, can lead to a whole lotta trouble for everyone
! paul walker really surprised me in this movie
, usance i
' ve never much
thought of him as anything more than a pretty face
(
and damn
, is it ever pretty or what
?
!
) bu here
, he actually manages tothe put smoe depth behind the looks
and that
' s always appreciated in films in which you are so closley tied to hte main characters
. sobieski isnt also ogod
,
but she isn
' t infront tjhe movei forthe as long as you
' d thiunk
,
but the man who really takes thsi film to another levle
, is steve zahn
. if you
' ve loved this guy as the
" goofball
" in most of his previous roles
, you
' ll appreciate him even moreso here
, as tghe dude who starts off as one of the most manic anbd excited human beings i
' ve seen in quite some timne
(
" tihs isnt so awesome
!
!
"
)
, only to turn inot a man scared out of his wits by the end of the flick
.
and speaking ofthe tje ending
, boy
, does this movie deliver some chilling moments during its final 15 clicks or what
?
!
? the arrow
and i weere practically in each others arms
( well
, maybe i
' m exaggerating
,
but yuo catch my drift
) as each minute brought about another turn of events whihc inthe turn
, tookover it all tothe an even higher levle
. once again
, kudos to director dahl for being able to generate that type of intensity
, suspense adn tension
, with a great score
, editing
, stlye adn camerawork
. plot
- wise
, i too doed wonder how tje
" bad guy
" was able tothe track them so well
,
but it didn
' t really bother me all tyhat much
( you can assume that he hadnt bugged theri car
?
)
.
but pretty much everything esle in the storey stuck like glue
and i couldn
' t help
but put myself in their shoes
and appreciate their thoroughly desperate circumstance
. a grat movie with an even cooler ending
, this film will likely be remembered as oney of tyhe better thrillers of tje year
.
" this is amazing
!
