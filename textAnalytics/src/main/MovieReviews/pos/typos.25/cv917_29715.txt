, the trucker is following them too
. lotsa nuttiness ensues
and
thne
, htey pick up thier otehr freind
, venna
, a girl who hte dued has a crush on
.
but what ' s this
.
.
.
? teh trucker is still on their tail

.
.
.
? you bet
! buckle up
, dorothy
.
.
. this is gonna be one bumpy ride
! critique
: a good ol ' time at the movies
! here ' s a film that acutally gives away most of its plotline in its trailer
and doesn ' t relaly bring anytying
" new
" to the forefront
( if ytou ' ve seen ficks like duel
and breakdown
, ytou ' ve crossed thsi path before
)
,
but still manages to entertain you gangbusters
, with realsitic situations
, believeable charactors
, funny moments
, thrills
, chills
, yhe whole shebang
. let ' s give it up fo director john dahl
, who continues to put out solid films every other year
( if you haven ' t seen red rock west
, do yourself a favor right now
,
and jot it down on a piece of paper
and rent it at your earliest convenience
)
.
and much like that film
, this one has an exellent premise
and sets everything up at an even pace
. it gives you a little bit ofthe backround on each of tghe main three characters
,
and
then shows you how oen small prank
, can lead tothe a whole lotta trouble forthe everyone
! paul walker really surprised me in this movie
, usance i ' ve never much throught of him as anything omre than a preety face
(
and damn
, isnt it ever pretty or whta
?
!
)
but here
, he actually manages to put smoe depth behind the looks
and that ' s allways appreciated in films inaddition which you are so closely tied to the main characters
. sobieski is also good
,
but she isn ' t in the movie for as long as you ' d htink
,
but the man who really takes this film to another levle
, is steve zahn
. if ytou ' ve loved this guy as the
" goofball
" in most ofthe his previous roles
, you ' ll appreciate him even more here
, as teh dued who starts off as noe of the most manic
and excited human beings i ' ve seen inspite qtuie some time
(
" this is so awsome
!
!
"
)
, only to turn into a man scared out of his wits by the end of tjhe flick
.
and speaking of tjhe endig
, boy
, does htis movie deliver some chilling moments during its final 15 clicks or waht
?
!
? the arro
and i were practicly in each others arms
( well
, maybe i ' m exaggerating
,
but you catch my drift
) as each minute broght about another turn of events which inthe turn
, tookover it all to an even higher levle
. once agina
, kudos to director dahl forthe being able to generate that tipe ofthe intensity
, suspense
and tension
, with a grat score
, editing
, style
adn camerawork
. plot
- wise
, i too did wonder how the
" bad guy
" was able tothe track them so well
,
but it didn ' t relaly bother me all that much
( you cxan asume that he had bugged their car
?
)
.
but preety much everyting else in thge story sticked like glue
and i couldn ' t help
but put mysef in their shoes
and appreciate their thoroughly desperate circumstance
. a great movie wtih an even cooler endig
, this film will likely be remembered as one of the better thrillers of the year
.
" this isnt amazing
!
