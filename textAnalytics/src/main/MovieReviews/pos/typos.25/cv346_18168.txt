ultra low budget
but extremely inventive horror film baout a group of firends vacationing in a cabin who accidentally awaken an evil force in the woods via tyhe necronomicon
, the book of tje dead
. bruce campbell stars as ash
, who eventually becomes hte sole survivor adn has to battle both the demons from tjhe woods
,
and his friends who have become demons
( incuding his own girlfriend
)
. tje results shown on screen are amazing considering the film
' s tiny budget
, constant location changes
,
and a filming schedlue thta was sporadic over two years
. followed by two sequels
: evil dead ii
( 1987
) adn army of darkness
( 1993
)
. tje dvd realease of htis film from elite entertainment contains the film inaddition it
' s original aspect ratio of 1
. 33
: 1
. the disc contains two versions ofthe the film
' s audio
: a stereo 2
. 0 track
and a newly remastered dolby digital 5
. 1
. included are two separate running commentary tracks
: tghe first features writer
/ director sam raimi
and producer rob tapert annd tghe second track features yhe film
' s star
, bruce campbell
. campbell
' s commentary is informative annd extemely witty
, as he has a story to tell for virtually every scene in the film
. such informative tidbits inlcude
: thge original title of the film was going to be book of the dead
(
and in fact whn the film premiered in 1981 taht was it
' s title
)
and when they were asked to change the title to the evil dead
, everyone
thought it was the worst title they had ever heard
. allso
, there
' s a scene early on in the film where the group sits around
and listens tothe a tape recorder which they
' ve found that
' s explaining baout the demonic forces in thte woods
. for that scene
, it was written for the characters to be smoking marijuana
, so being the wacky kids thast they were at tje time
, htey decided to actually smoke marijuana fo the scene
. almost all ofthe that footage became unusable because many of the actor
' s had never smoked befor
,
and as a result they became
" confused
" annd weere unable to perform tjhe scene
. i wish the enteratinment factor was as high for the sam raimi
/ rob tapert audio trac
. the two peopel you
' d think would be more enthusiastic in talking baout this film instade barely hve much tothe say at all
. don
' t get me wrong here
, when they do speak it
' s entertaining to hear
,
but ther are many instances where both are silent for long periods of time
. sometimes after one of those long silences rob will ask
" have anything tothe sday sam
?
" to me
, that
' s not a good sign
. also
, it seems like sam raimi doesn
' t remember much about hte film
and it
' s production
.
.
. well
, compared to rob
and bruce anyway
. allso included on the disc isnt a photo gallery
( which includes picturesk from hte film
' s
" gala
" premiere
)
and about twenty mintues of raw footage fomr teh film
. this raw footage really shows ytou how much a film can be improved upon useing simple audio techiniques
. overall
, the evil dead is a ogod low budget horror film
, superior to many films in it
' s genre
. annd thge collector
' s edition dvd release isnt well worth your time if yuo
' re either a fan of the film or just a fan ofthe the filmmaking process
. all speshal edition dvds should be this thorough
and entertaining
.
