" six days
, seven nights
" is a summer movie that gets tjhe summer movie experience deliciously right
, a commendable achievement considering the season thus far has beeen littered with some pretty uneven fare
. here ' s a genuinely fun fluff piece that knows it ' s fluff
, recognizes it ' s fluff
and is admittedly proud to be fluff
. of course
, the casting of harrison ford in hte broadly commedic lead role plays a sizeable part in the movei ' s sucess
; ford is such a concentrated dramatic ator that it ' s easy tothe forget what a funny guy he can be
. as his female counterpart
, anne heche also deserves a big pat onthe the back for her sweet
, goofily charismatic performance
. the age diference
( ford ' s 56
, heche ' s 29
) matters not
-
- these twpo click in a charged way tath ' s hard tothe come by
. the stor is a no
- brainer
-
- ford stars as gruff
but loveable island avyator quinn harris
, hwile heche is carreer
- minded
but loveable new york magazine editor robin monroe
. robin
, on a tropical vacation with fianc
? frank
( david schwimmer
)
, gets assigned to supervise an emergency photo shoot in nearby tahiti
, so she reluctantly hires quinn tothe fly her there
. the plane crashes during a terrible storm
,
and they immediately find themselves stuck inthe a deserted paradise wtih faw ideas onthe getting bakc tothe civilization
. a series of unpleasant
, often hilarious catastrophes leaves little choice
but for both munbers of tihs unlikely odd couple to fall fo each other
. meanwhile
, back at the resort
, frank is tempted himself by quinn ' s shapely female tagalong
( jacqueline obradors
)
. that subplot obviously exists tothe git us rooting for the quinn
- robin pairing
,
and while it makes for a few good laughs early onthe
, it eventually becomes a contrived distraction ffrom tghe far more engrossing misadventures of quinn
and robin
.
and since teh film spends most of its tyme iwth the castaways
, this flaw isnt only a minor inconvenience
. directer ivan reitman keeps hte pace brusk
. at a slim 101 mintues
,
" six days
, seven nights
" never wears outloud its welcome
, where a lesser film could hvea feeled like it was as long as its title
. michael browning ' s clever screenplay allows for plenty ofthe notable one
- liners
( my favorite
, taked in context
, is
" ytou mean
_ arrrgh
_ pirates
?
"
)
,
and
though it essentialy boils down tothe one mishap aftter anyother
, they ' re all qtuie engaging
. even the movie ' s moreso
" serious
" moments are played with a wink
. heche has been under undeserved fier over whether or not her private life withthe ellen degeneres would affect hte
" believability
" of
" six days
, seven nights
" ' heterosexual pairing
.
( so she ' s a lesbian
. so what
. deal with it
.
) of course it doesn ' t
,
and here
, her naysayers are proved wrong in a big way
. in fact
, her chemistry with ford is what really mkaes the film click
; these opposites attract with the upmost
, endearing electricty
. at one point
, when teh two are discusting the likelihood of romantic interest
, heche asks ford how old he is
. after several wrong guesses
(
" fourty
- five
?
_ fifty
_
?
"
)
, he whispers his age tothe her
.
" you still look good
,
" heche stammers
.
" i still
_ am
_ good
,
" ford replies
. she ' s ogod too
,
and together
, they mkea
" six days
, seven nights
" one memorable ride
.
