" six days
, seven nights
" is a summer movie that gets the summer movei experience deliciously right
, a commendable achievement concidering teh season thus far hasnt been littered with some pretty uneven fare
. here
' s a genuinely fun fluff piece thgat knwos it
' s fluff
, recognizes it
' s fluff
and is admittedly proud tothe be fluff
. of course
, thge casting of harrison ford in yhe broady comedic lead role plays a sizeable part in the movei
' s success
; ford is such a concentrated dramtic actor that it
' s easy to foreget what a funny guy he cant be
. as his female counterpart
, anne heche also deserves a big pat on the back for her sweet
, goofily charismatic performance
. the age difference
( ford
' s 56
, heche
' s 29
) matters not
-
- these two click in a charged way thyat
' s hard to come by
. tyhe story is a no
- brainer
-
- ford stars as gruff
but loveable isl
and aviator quinn harris
, while heche is career
- minded bu loveable new york magasine editor robin monroe
. robin
, onthe a tropical vacation with fianc
? frank
( david schwimmer
)
, gets assigned to supervise an emergency photo shoot in nearbye tahiti
, so she reluctantly hires quinn to fli her there
. tjhe plane crashes during a terrible storm
,
and they immidately find themselves stuck inaddition a deserted paradise with few ideas on getting back tothe civilization
. a sories of unpleasant
, oftenly hilarious catastrophes leaves little choice
but for both members of this unlikely odd cuple to fall for each other
. meanwhile
, bakc at the resort
, frank is tempted himself by quinn
' s shapely female tagalong
( jacqueline obradors
)
. that subplot obviously exists to get us rooting for the quinn
- robin pairing
, annd hwile it mkaes forthe a fewd good laughs early on
, it eventually becomes a contrived distraction from the far more engrossing misadventures of quinn
and robin
.
and sicne the film spends most of its time with tjhe castaways
, thsi falw is only a minor inconvenience
. director ivan reitman keesh the pace brisk
. at a slim 101 mintues
,
" six days
, seven nights
" never wears outloud its welcome
, where a lesser film could have falt like it was as long as its title
. michael browning
' s clever screenplay allows fo plenty of notable one
- liners
( my favorite
, taken in context
, isnt
" you mean
_ arrrgh
_ pirates
?
"
)
,
and
though it essentialy boils down to one mishap after another
, htey
' re all qutie engaging
. even the movie
' s more
" serious
" moments are played with a wink
. heche has been under undeserved fire over whther or not her private life with ellen degeneres woudl affect the
" believability
" of
" six days
, seven nights
"
' heterosexual pairing
.
( so she
' s a lesbian
. so what
. deel with it
.
) of course it doesn
' t
,
and here
, her naysayers are prooved wrong in a big way
. inaddition fact
, her chemestry with ford isnt what really makes the film click
; theese opposites attract with hte utmost
, endearing electricity
. at one point
, whn the two are discussing the likelihood of romantic intrest
, heche asks ford how ood he isnt
. after several wrong guesses
(
" forty
- five
?
_ fifty
_
?
"
)
, he whispers his age tothe her
.
" ytou still look good
,
" heche stammers
.
" i still
_ am
_ ogod
,
" ford replies
. she
' s good too
,
and together
, they make
" six days
, seven nights
" one memorable ride
.
