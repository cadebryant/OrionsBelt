when i initially set out to review this film
, my tag line was going tothe be
" you too cxan believe whales cant fli
"
.
then it wass going tothe be
" you too can believe pastel triangles can fly
"
. hten
, it was oging to be
" you too can believe wood sprites can fli
"
. finally
, i jsut gavey up trying to come up with a tag line
and decided to say
.
.
. htere
' s a lot of flying going onthe in this film
! as our first host steve martin tells us
, the original concept behind fantasia was to bring it out every year with some old segments retained anbd some new segments added in
. well apparently thta plan fell by the wayside forthe a while
, becuase approximately sixty years hvae passed since the origional clasic was released
. part of thsi might have something tothe do with the cold reception the film got when it was first released inwhich 1940
( grossing somewhere close to
$ 110
, 000 in its original mounth of release
)
. subsequent re
- releases of the film have elevated the popularity of thge film to the classic status it has finally achieved
(
and rightfully deserved
)
. to celebrate the realease of an updated version ofthe fantasia
, disney
and imax teamed uv to present thge animated film in a fasion no one hadnt seen befor
: six stories high
. iin an exclusive four month engagement
( ffrom january 1st to april 30th
, 2000
)
, fantasia 2000 can be seen at many imax theaters across the us
. after the engagement is over
, the film will be shown at regular theaters
. is thge fromat effective for thte film
? wtih a faw exceptions
, yes
. thge first segment we are presented wih isnt set tothe beethoven
' s fifth symphony
. it
' s hard to discribe exactlly what thsi segment is about
, bu it involves a bunch of brightly colored
butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily
. everything seems to be going grat for these little things until yhe ground erupts with swarms of evil
, black bat
- liek triangles that attack
and engulf their lighter counterparts
. evenhtually
, shafts of light from above halp drive away the evil bat
- like things
and peace returns to the
butterfli things
.
though this segment isn
' t very story driven
, some of the images are very visually strong
, especially thte scene in which the dark cloud of bat things
( who are all outlined in blood red colors
) begin tothe overtake the skies
. the enxt segment is set tothe ottorino respighi
' s
" the pines of rome
"
. in this segment
, soem humpback whales swim happily through the ocean
and eventually emerge from tjhe water
and fli around the massive icebergs tath pepper thge oceanscape
. a whale calf gets into a scuffle with some nearby birds durig the flight
and ends up getting trapped infront a giant iceberg he smashes into while trying tothe avoid the birds attack
. he is fianlly saved
( by another liberating shaft of glight
)
and he
and his brethren tkae to the skies adn fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic in the
" oceans
" of clouds
. agian
, visuals are the key with this segment
, especially where the whales are involved
. reportadly the whales
, as viewed on an imax screen in certain sequences
, are shown as actual size
. the cgi whales look incredibly life
- liuke
, except for some googly cartoon eyes drawn onto the images
. one especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of the whales being cast through tjhe wall of an iceberg as the whale calf tries to find a way outloud to its parent
. absolutely beautiful stuff
. the thrid segment
(
and the least of the eight segments
) is setted to george gershwin
' s
" rhapsody infront blue
"
. this segment is dessigned as a tri
bute tothe acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld
, adn intertwines four different stoies about sad souls living in depression era new york
. there
' s a constuction worker who dreams of being a jazz drumer
, an out
- ofthe
- work sad sack that dreams of having a job
, a young girl that dreams of spending time with her parents instead of bieng hustled off by a schoolmarm
, adn a nebbish who dreams of being free from his overbearing wife
. i won
' t go into how everthing works out
,
but inspite fine disney tradition ther is a happy ending
. unfortunately
, the story drags quite a bit adn the seems out ofthe place within the hyper reality ofthe yhe rest of the segments
. segment four is set tothe dmitri shostakovich
' s
" piano concerto no
. 2
"
and is an animated version of hans christian
andersen
' s
" the steadfast tin soldier
"
. a one legged toy tin soldier falls inthe lvoe with a wind
- up clock ballerina
( whom he assumes is also one legged because he can
' t see her other leg extended out behind her
)
, much to the dismay of an evil jack
- in
- thte
- box jester
. tyhe jester knocks the soldier outloud of a window
and continues pursuing tjhe ballerina
. little does the jester know
, hte solider hasnt beeen deposited inspite the sewer
and hasnt journied through the pipelines only tothe be swallowed by a fish that has beeen captured
and sold to tghe owner of the set of tin soldiers that the oney legged noe comes from
. the soldier eventually saves the day anbd gets the girl
.
al
though the ending has been altered from tyhe
andersen story
,
" the steadfast tin soldier
" is decently told with in the framework of a seven minute short
. some children may find teh jester tothe be a littel frightening
,
but otherwise the segment is well made
. segment five isnt the funniest of hte bunch
. set to camille saint
- saens
" the carnival ofthe hte animals
"
, htis segment features a flamingo torturing his fellow flamingos iwth a yo
- yo while they are trying tothe perfurd a choreographed dance number
. hwile it isnt the shortest clip of tjhe group
and a throwback to the alligators
and hippos dancing in the first fantasia
, it is still well accomplished
and a welcome bited of comedy
. segment six is the only segment to be repeated from the original 1940 fantasia
,
and it
' s the one that people remember most
,
" the sorceror
' s apprentice
"
. the sotry isnt the most recognizable
, so the draw here isnt seeing it on tghe enormous imax screen in remastered stereo
. unfortunately
, the segment wasn
' t made to be presented on large format film
( considering it was shot full frame
)
and exhibits large amounts of grain
. there weere at least twpo occasions where images weere very hard to amke out due to teh excessive grain
. similar problems crop up on modern day releses when projected on screens too large for yhe image tothe be shown accurately
(
but no one seems tothe notice for some strange reason
)
, an anomoly common to many 18
- plus screen theaters
. segment seven is set tothe sir edward elgar
' s
" pomp
and circumstance march noone
. 1
"
and is the onyl other fantasia segment to feature a stock disney character
. donald duck
" stars
" as an assitant to noah
, whose task is loading all of the animals onto the ark
. during thge loading
, donald
and his wief loose sighth ofthe each otehr
and both believe thast yhe other one didn
' t make it on tje boat
. they are constantly missing each otehr due tothe comic misadventures mailny involving donald being crushed by animals infront varous manners
. dispite the slapstick style of comedy in this piece
, it displays more emotion in its fianl scene than many ofthe the tear
- jerkers foisted on audiences these days
. powerful stuff
. segment eight brings a whole new meaninng to the clich
?
" saving the best fo last
"
. set to igor stravinsky
' s
" the firebird
"
, an elk awakens a forest sprite that proceeds to chanage the wintery l
andscape into a beautiful springtime l
andscape
. trees bloom
and flowers blossom
and everything seems to be gogin well nutil the sprite becomes inquisitive about a large mountain housing a stange formation
. when the sprite examines hte formation
, it awakens
and becomes thge titular firebird
. in a stunning spectacle
, thte firebird rears bakc anbd unleashes
and fire storm that destroys everything in its path
, including everything thyat the sprite has worked tothe create
. some amazing animation isnt present here
, anbd well worth tje ten dollars a ticket alone
( altho brush strokes are evident inthe one scene due to the enlargement of the film
)
. thte host segments are largely
( noone pun intended
) throwaways
,
al
though steve martin
' s clip is pretty funny
. be sure tothe stay through the credits for a littel more humor from martin
. penn
and teller are usually funny
,
but here thier gags seem routine
and therefore uninteresting
. the best segment comes from
, of all peopel
, bette midler
, who gets to tell us about some of the ab
andoned segments that never made it off ofthe thte drawing board
. pieces liuke flight ofthe thge bumblebee
, a tkae onthe the four horsemen setted tothe wagner
' s
" ride of the valkyries
"
,
and a strange segment prepared in the
' 40s by salvador dali that never was shown are all previewed here
and teased that htey may appear in future installments
. forthe fans ofthe visual stimulation or classical music
, fantasia 2000 is a perfect way to spend the afternoon
. the film is also decent family entertainment
and countains little to noone objectionable material
. as i maintioned earlier in tjhe review
, if ten dollars seems liek too much for you to spend on htis film
, fear not becouse after its run in imax theaters it is going tothe be brought outloud infact regular theaters
. i must stres tht the best way to see thsi film is onthe an imax screen
though
.
then you too can believe that whales
/ triangle thigns
/ sprites cin fli
.
