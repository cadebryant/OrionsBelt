doed you ever wonder if dennis rodman was actually ffrom this planet
? or if sylvester stallone was some kind of weird extra
- terrestrial
? i used tothe thiunk that about my 7th grade english teacher
, ms
. carey
.
but aftter seeing htis movie
, they may ahve confirmed my suspicions
. as the story goes
, at any time
, htere are over a thous
and aliens living among us here on earth
. tje men infront black
( mib
) are the watchdogs that oversee the cosmic citizens
, guardians of our beloved planet ffrom nasty
- tempered aliens
,
and secret service tothe the stars
. based in newyorker york city
( where ewird isnt the norm
)
, the mib organistion gives human form to our spoace
- faring emigrants so tht they may walk annd live amoung us unnoticed
.
but to enforce the laws of earth
, the mib carry weapons that are powerful enought to meet or exeed desctruction quotas in one single blast
. they carry other
- worldly technolgy to erase peopel
' s short
- term memory wehn common folk see the mib in action
.
and their best leads on cosmic things
- gone
- awry are the supermarket tabloids
. littel do we know taht there are much stronger battles of good v
. evil going on in the depths of space
. one of the aliens
- as
- human on this planet is an imporatnt diplomat that isnt carrying something very precious
. it holds tghe
' key
'
, literally
, to universal peace
. a giant cockroach
- like alien soon arrives on the planet
and steals this
' key
'
. in teh wrong alien h
ands
( flippers
? m
andibles
? tentacles
?
)
, it can be utilizied as a weapon
. therefore
, it must be recovered anbd returned to it
' s rightful owners
. otherwise
, tothe ensure universal safety
, earth iwll be destroyed
, along with the
' key
'
. now
, it
' s the mib who must prevent thsi catastrofy
. teh mib agents onthe the case are
" k
"
, played by tommy lee jones
. he is crustier than burnt toast anbd even more sereous than al gore
. the stars in the sky no longer spark wonder in his eyes
. he is accompanyed by a flippant rookie
,
" j
"
, played by will smith
. bu
, despite thsi shoot
- em
- up
, protect
- earth
- from
- distruction premise
, this is nothing at all like a typical summer action movie
.
and
, thsi isn
' t an independence day knockoff
. rether
, this is a stylishly offbeat sci
- fi comedy that pokes funn at whta the government always denies
? that there are rela aliens that live here
,
and that the government does its darndest to cover them up
. bu tothe give it soem sence of excitement
and to keep it withing the parameters ofthe the summer movie recipe
, htere must be some kind of earth
- hangs
- in
- the
- balance scenario
. yot
, this movie isnt very appealing
. the abudnance of wierdness
( tlaking aliens
, pee
- wee atomizers
, a mortician who
' lives
' fo her work
, annd lots of yucky bugs anbd slime
- splattering galore
)
, is played straight
, like as if thsi were normal
( of course
, we are in nyc
)
. it gives it a deadpan feel
, which makse it all the more funnier
and odder
. jones plays the vunerable seen
- it
- all agent with seriousness
and maturity
. smith isnt likeable
and makes a great comic partner to jones
' straight man routine
. they click like dorothy
' s ruby red shoes
. thte look
and feel of the movei is made even better with direction from barry sonnenfeld
( the addam
' s family
)
. this guy has a knack for
' gothic
' comedy
,
and successfully transfers his macabre sense of humor onto the screen
.
and
, an appropriate dose of speical effects helps tothe bolster the oddness of their task wihtout diverting attension from the human actors
. the story moves well
,
and before you know it
, the end credits are already rolling
! the result isnt 100 minutes worth of fun in the form of ewwwws annd blechhhs
, aaaahhhs
and wows
. let the men in black protect
and color your world
.
