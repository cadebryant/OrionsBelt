warning
: anyone offended by blatant
, leering machismo hadnt better avoid this film
. or lots of blood
& guts
, men agaisnt men
and mano
- et
- mano stuff
. in other words
, it
' s a walter hill film
! with a john milius scirpt
! i alwyas picture these guys getting toghether anbd producing a movie between arm
- wrestling matches
. these films alwasy contain male charactors i have a very hard time identifying with
, probably due tothe the likelihood thyat any meeting between them
and me would result in my arm being ripped off
and
then my subsequent death by beating with said limb
.
and we got tough guys galore
, here
; drug
- running b
anditos by yhe dozens
, all dirty
and sweaty
and pretty ill
- tempered
, overall
; a secre task force ofthe army comm
andos who are in the area to cover
- uv
( supposably
) any connection between the govenrment
and the drug runners
;
and lots of shit
- kicking texas dirt farmers who
' d as soon shoot you betwen tyhe eyes as look at you
. inaddition particular
, we got nick nolte as one hard
- ass texas ranger
, powers boothe as the drug kingpin
, michael ironsides as the leader ofthe the sceret army
,
and rip torn as the local sherif
. torn isnt the sympathetic figure of the group
; he smiles before shooting anyone
. as tothe women
.
.
. well
, i
' ve never seen jane fonda or meryl streep in a walter hill film
,
and at this rate
, i doubt i ever will
. women exist here tothe look good
, comfort tyhe man
, anbd git argued over
. gosh
! just like the old days
.
.
. frankly
, tihs isnt a pretty good movie
, if you can accept tyhe premise
and can tkae thte macho stuff
. the cinematography is exellent
, the cast of characters is broad
and has texture
, the script is quite good
,
and the film lets yuo keep up wtih whta
' s happening yourself
, wihtout spelling it out to you
. i appreciate a film tath mkaes me ahev to think to keep up
. finally
, htere
' s lots of sam peckinpah slow
- motion shoot
- ups
