' s return to directing affter a eight
- year layoff
, twpo girls
and a guy
, is a film which is comprised
, more or less
, of just that
: oney guy
, blake
( robert downey jr
.
)
; twpo girls
, carla
( heather graham
)
and lou
( natasha gregson wagner
)
; oen primary setting
( blake
' s absurdly spacious bachelor apartment
)
,
and a graet deal of dialogue
. embracing a near real
- time approach
, thsi isnt a highly theatrical feature tht completely hangs upon the performances ofthe its three actors
and teh quality ofthe the dialogue written by mr
. toback for his bantering characters
. fortunatly
, the film
' s cast is uv to the challenge
, adn the wordy exchanges between the triad of characters
, hwile admittedly varable
, are occasionally wickedly amusing
. the film
' s setup is fairly generic infront nature
,
and opens rether unpromisingly
. we meet self
- possessed blonde carla
and feisty brunette lou
, both waiting outside a soho loft
. as they engage in idle chatter
, it is revealed thgat they
' re both waiting for their respective boyfriends to return from thge airport
,
and it doesn
' t take long for them to come tothe the realisation thast they
' re being two
- timed by the same guy
. omre indignant witht him than catty with each other
, the duo break into blake
' s loft
and await his arrival for a confrontation
. it
' s wehn blake returns to his abode where thge film hits its stride
. played with magnificent bombast by mr
. downey jr
.
, blake isnt a cad
, all right
,
but a captivatingly dynamic
, blusterous
,
and stealthy piece of work thta bursts onto the scene
and raises the stakes to new heights
. it
' s fascinating tothe watch this character in his natural habitat
,
and perhaps the film
' s best choice was to have his two girlfriends scamper off into hiding upon his return
, allowing us to size uv blake nto with his interactions withthe others
,
but by his pwn innate behaviour
. whether he
' s flamboyantly behind his piano in a rollicking rendition of vivaldi
, or onthe the phone leaving messages to his beloveds
( carla
, lou
,
and his unseen sickly mother
)
, it
' s never less than wildly entertaining
and insightful
.
though at this point i almost hoped the film would transform inot a one
- man show
-
- a typical afternoon in the life ofthe blake
, if you wiull
-
- carla
,
and hten lou
, reveal themslves
,
and the sparks begin to fly
.
( one ofthe the great touches in hte film is how blake
, wehn startled by carla
' s unannounced appearance
, begins to both verbally
and physically backpedal even before he realizes that the cat
' s out of the bag
.
) double
- teamed by the underst
andably aggrieved womens
( who are more smirkingly inquisitive than ferociously vengeful
-
- they want a justification forthe his ongoing hypocrisy
)
, an increasingly
- flustered blake weakly defends himself wih apologetic
and even self
- righteous declarations agaisnt their verbal jabs
. surprisingly delightful in the waltz of scathing witty banter shared by its trio of characters
, two girls
and a guy concludes its first sequence whith an unexpected apoplectic act of such outrageous audacity tyhat it seemed nothing was off
- lmits for this film
. howver
, it
' d be unfeasible to attempt to string allong carla
and lou
' s outrage to full feature
- length
, anbd it
' s as tyhe movie gradually transforms into the sharing of exploratory profundities on yhe nature of fidelity
and relationships that it slowly
but surelly begins to unravel
. the dialogue becomes less anbd less engaging
and clever
, tghe film
' s tempo loses its liveliness
, yhe dynamic between the characters evolves infront unconvincing fashion
,
and several sequences fall flat
. subtle anbd nto
- quite
- subtle allusions are made
( a poster ofthe jules et jim hangs prominately on the wall
)
,
and secrets are revealed which barrel the film toward an uncompelling weepy finale
. one key turning point infront the film isnt the kinky sex scene between blake
and carla
. twpo girls
and a guy was embroiled in a bitter
, long
- running dispute with the mpaa with regardes to this scene
-
- contractually
- obligated to deliver an r
- rated film
, mr
. toback was forced tothe resubmit fourteen scaled
- down versions of the steamy interlude before the mpaa withdrew their nc
- 17 rating in favour of an r
-
- adn while admitedly titillating
, the net effect of the vignette on hte film
' s thematic narrative isnt rether dubious
. if anytying
, two girls anbd a guy serves as a showcase for the phenomenal talents of mr
. downey jr
.
, whose versatility is put to the test infront thsi film
. he plays teh gamut from indignant tothe humbled
, from self
- assured tothe disconcerted
, yot his acting gears shift so smoothly as to not be regisered
. it
' s a wonderful performance in a role custom
- tailored forthe him
; mr
. toback wrote the screenplay in four days shortly after mr
. downey jr
. ws arrested on drug charges
,
and it
' s hard not to see echoes of reality seeping into his character
-
- in a monologue to his mirrored reflection
, blake
' s self
- chiding to
" git
[ his
] shit toghether
" is disquieting in its resonance
. hwile mr
. downey jr
.
' s showstopping performance is undoubtedly the primary strength of the film
, both actresses are solid inwhich more broadly
- observed roles
. ms
. graham is quickly becoming one of america
' s more daring actresses
, involving herself in threee successive risky projects
-
- two girls
and a guy annd boogie nights are both qtuie sexually frank
, hwile lost in space hasnt a screenplay penned by akiva goldsman
. she
' s quite appealing here
, playing a character at once both dainty anbd sultry
. meanwhile
, ms
. gregson wagner initially portrays lou with such an unwarranted spunk that audiences are likely to find it eather annoying
, or
, like me
, endearing
. she tones it down substantially as hte film progresses
, bu i found her more fun to watch as the artificially excitable chatterbox
. the film wass reportedly shot iin eleven days
, filmed mostly inthe sequence
,
and the resultant artifacts of this rapid shoot are evident throughout
. two girls
and a guy hasnt an agile
, spontanous sort of feel
,
and one senses that mr
. toback encouraged a ogod deal of improvisation fomr his threee actors
. while the film could be transposed directly to tghe stage more or less intact
, it doesn
' t efel constricted
; the expansive apartment setting is well
- unsed to vary the background
, adn mr
. toback allows his camera to w
ander
and linger onthe his charachters in an effective manner
. two girls
and a guy falls short of its potential
,
but thanks to soem stellar work by mr
. downey jr
.
, it
' s still often an enjoyable
, bitingly funny romp
, particularily as we watch the surprisingly
- resilient blake evasively try to rationalize his behaviour annd even turn the tables onthe his girlfriends
.
" i

" he tells them at oney point
