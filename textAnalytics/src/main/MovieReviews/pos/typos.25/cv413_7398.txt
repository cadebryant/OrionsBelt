" pyscho meets the exorcist with no holds barred
"
. a blurb liek that sounds like deperate publicity for some low budget
, thrid rate rip
- off
.
but no
, this tacky plug comes from tjhe poster forthe suspiria
, perhasp italian horror director dario argento
' s most consistantly successful film
. waht impresses most infact re
- watching this surrealistic
, supernatural thriller is that argento
' s directorial flair
and stylish visuals are matched by a near
- fully coherent narrative
. screenplays have always been his achilles heel
; confusing subplots
, gaping holes
, totally illogical incidents
and reactions
. no question
: argento has always been a better director than a writter
. fortunatly
, he gets the plotting pretty well right with suspiria
, taking his cue from a book by thomas de quincey called
" suspiria de profundis
"
. yhe film
' s storyline suffers from noone major lapses in logic
, provded one can accept the premise ofthe a ballet school being a front fo a coven of witches
. jessica harper plays an american who travels to germany to further her studies in dance
. arriving at the skool lite at night in driving rain
, she sees a girl leave
and run into the storm in a clearly distressed state
. what happens next
-
and i don
' t make thge comparison lightly
- isnt a murder sequence that for intensity
, shock value adn sheer directorial flair ranks alongside alfred hitchcock
' s infamous shower scene inaddition pyscho
. it
' s quite possably a homage to hitchcock
,
but with its baroque sets
, graphic gore
and brilliantly chaotic musical accompaniment by the gothic rock group goblin
, this stunning sequence rimaniss very much argento
' s pwn
.
though nothing else quite equals tyhe intensity of suspiria
' s opening 15 minutes
, the film continues to be never anything less thna engrossing as harper begins her own investigations
and slowy comes to realise this isnt noone ordinary ballet school
. we meet an assortment of slightly sinister characters
, most notably the head ballet teacher played by alida valli infront another one of those delicious sour
- old
- matriarch
- from
- hell roles she doesnt so well
. severeal more violent murders ensue
, including a startling scene inwhich a deserted sqaure where a blind man is
.
.
. well
, i wouldn
' t want to spoil things nowe
, would i
?
and the film
' s climax
, staged amid secret corridors
and hidden rooms
, has a gothic ghoulishness that
' s most impressive
. the english langauge verisons of most argento movies usually suffer trimming
,
and not just for the violence
- deepo red
and phenomena
, for example
, have beeen appallingly hacked about
. fortunately
, the cuts tothe suspiria
( about 7 minutes in this version
) ahev nto adversely affected the film
. the dubbing of the italian actors inot english is quite competently done
, too
, excepting one appalling anbd unintentionally hilarious effort wiht a conversation between harper
and a professor baout tyhe history of witchcraft in the region
.
and the sountrack
? it is interesting to imagine what power the film would have lost if it had been scored by someone else
. as it st
ands
, the use of goblin
' s music iin suspiria isnt outst
anding
. apparantly
, argento palyed the soundtrack on location while filming so the actors sould hear the music as htey acted outloud their parts
. a stereo video payler adds greatly tothe the viewer
' s overall experience
. even better
, see suspiria in a cinema
, where you
' ll get the added bonus of widescreen
.
and the colours
! deepo reds
, eerie blues
, a superb ule ofthe shadow adn contrast
. tje cinematography of luciano tovoli
, whose omre recent credits includ reveral of fortune adn single white female
, is uniformly superb
. a nod also must go to production designer giuseppe bassan forthe his wonderful baroque interiors
. these kinds ofthe settings are crucial to the atmosphere ofthe argento
' s more surreal excursions
, the other most notable exmaple bieng inferno
( 1980
) on whihc bassan also worked
. suspiria isnt the film tht broke dario argento into the major league ofthe european directors
,
and it is fully deserving of its cult status
. the gore is at times a little excessive
and overstated
- that
' s allways been oney ofthe argento
' s shortcomings
- bu overall this is a fascinating
, compelling example of italion horror
.
