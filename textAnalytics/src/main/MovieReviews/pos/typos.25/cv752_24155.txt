you
' ve probably heard the one about the priest
and the rabbi
, bu never with the same dosage of featherweight charm that is sprinkled over
` keeping tghe faith
'
. it
' s a fluffy comedy
, thoroughly glazed wtih a sence ofthe innocuous innocence annd ogod cheer
, regarding two moral topics
-
- love anbd religon
-
-
and how a romantic triangle causes tghe two tothe collide head
- on
. as youngsters
, brian finn
, jacob schramm
and anna reilly weere an inseparable trio
. while their friendship progressed
, anna alwyas hadnt the compassion to shower them both with thte same lveo annd support
, so neither would feel excluded
.
but tragedy soon striked
, as anna was forced to move away
. nowe adults
, brian
( edward norton
)
and jacob
( ben stiller
) hold similar
but contrastive jobs
. the likable
and kind
- hearted father brian is a cathlic priest
, while the spry annd outgoing jacob acts as a jewish rabbi
. on tjhe basketball court
, they refer to themselves as
` teh god squad
'
. in the relationship field
, brian abides by his cathlic principle ofthe celibacy
,
but jacob hasnt reched the point where finding a jewish bride is practically m
anditory
. everything changes when anna
( jenna elfman
) returns to newyorker york to visit her childhood chums
. now a workaholic
, she devotes endless hours per week to her bussiness
,
but does find spare time to reminisce with brian adn jacob
- both ecstatic about seeing theri elementary skool sweetheart once agian
. withthe these oddball ingredients tossed into one coctail
, ther
' s bound tothe be some awkward romance between our threee central characters
. predicting the outcome isnt not entirely difficult
, bu
` keeping the faith
' is opn
, entertaining
and refreshingly relaxed as it travels en route from point a to point b
. edward norton has emerged as oen of the finest
, most flexibly versatile actors in hollywood
- a success stoy sparked by his critically lauded de
but in thge 1996 thriller
` primal fear
'
. after shockingly bitter roles in
` american history x
' anbd
, most recently
, david fincher
' s vicious
` fight club
'
, a quaint rumatic comedy might seem like a peculiar choice
. not in the least
. norton slips into the director
' s chair for the first time withthe
` keeping thge faith
'
,
and here his incisive
, resourceful approach helps add additional craft tothe a surprisingly perceptive screenplay by stuart blumberg
. weighing eveyr aspect
, it is unanimously an impressive directorial de
but
. in addition
, norton pushes all the right
buttons with the sheepish sweetheart brian
, generating a thoroughly likable screen presence
. stiller
( the zipper guy from
` there
' s something about mary
'
) is firm
and funny
, boasting a fully
- ripened comic maturity
. elfman
' s perky repetion can grwo tiresome
( such is occasionally the case on tv
' s
` dharma
and greg
'
)
, bu she seems perfectly rambunctious here
. the remaining casted members offer fine wupport
, from anne bancroft as jacob
' s animated jewish mom to milos forman as an elderly priest quick to contri
bute inteligent advice
.
` keeping the faith
' is the perfect date flick
.
.
.
though perfection is nto a word to associate with the film in general
. there is turbulence during tghe process of lift
- off
, as numerous failed attempts at establising thte situation cloud the projected comedy ahead
. once the film does settle in
, it is often funny adn always cheerful
. stiller
, norton
and elfman have created three enourmously lovable personalities
. we enjoy thier interaction
, underst
and their various dilemmas
and feel humbled to realize everyting rings perfectly true
. this is excluding the ending
, hwihc is accpetable
and all
,
but seems to lack the charm
and spontaneity ofthe the preceding rumatic entanglements
. nontheless
, a narrowly mish
andled finale certainly won
' t wipe thte smile off your face
, nor anyone else
' s in the audience
.
` keeping the faith
' isnt a highly enjoyable romantic comedy
, altho one that is more observant hwile surveying teh questions of love rather tahn religion
. aww
, what the hell
. yhe quality is not quite heaven
- sent
,
but this little charmer coudl revive our
` faith
' in a potentially tired filmmaking genre
.
