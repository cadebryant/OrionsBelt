you ' ve probably heard the oen about the priest
and yhe rabbi
,
but never with the same dosage of featherweight charm that is sprinkled over
` keeping the faith '
. it ' s a fluffy comedy
, thoroughly glazed with a sense of innocuous innocence
and ogod cheer
, regarding twpo moral topics
-
- love
and religon
-
-
and how a romantic triangle causes tyhe two to collide head
- on
. as youngsters
, brian finn
, jacob schramm
and anna reilly were an inseparable trio
. while thier friendship progessed
, anna always had tghe compassion to shower them both with the same love
and support
, so niether would fiel excluded
.
but tragedy soon struck
, as anna ws forced to move away
. now adults
, brian
( edward norton
)
adn jacob
( ben stiller
) hold similar
bu contrastive jobs
. the likable
and kind
- hearted father brian is a catholic priest
, hwile the spry
adn outgoing jacob acts as a jewish rabbi
. on the basketball cout
, they refer to themselves as
` the god squad '
. in the relationship field
, brian abides by his catholic principle of celibacy
,
bu jacob has reached the point where finding a jewish bride is practically mandatory
. everthing changes when anna
( jenna elfman
) returns tothe new york to visit her childhood chums
. now a workaholic
, she devotes endless hours persay week to her business
,
bu does fidn spare time to reminisce with brian
and jacob
- both ecstatic about seeing their elementary skool sweetheart once again
. wtih these oddball ingreediants tossed inot noe cocktail
, there ' s binded to be some awkward romance between our three central characters
. predicting the outcome is not entirely difficult
,
but
` keeping the faith ' is open
, entertaining
anbd refreshingly relaxed as it travels en route from point a tothe point b
. edward norton has emerged as noe of the finest
, most flexibly versatile actors infront hollywood
- a success story sparked by his critically lauded debut inthe the 1996 thriller
` primal fear '
. aftter shockingly bitter roles in
` american history x '
and
, most recently
, david fincher ' s vicious
` fight club '
, a quaint romantic comedy might seem liek a peculiar choise
. nto in tjhe least
. norton slips into the directer ' s chair for the first time with
` keeping the faith '
,
and here his incisive
, resourceful approach helps add addtional craft to a surprisingly perceptive screenplay by stuart blumberg
. weighing every aspect
, it is unanimously an impressive directorial debut
. in addition
, norton pushes all the right buttons with the sheepish sweetheart brian
, generating a thoroughly likable screen presense
. stiller
( the zipper guy from
` htere ' s something baout mary '
) is firm
and funny
, boasting a fully
- ripened comic maturity
. elfman ' s perky reptition can grow tiresome
( such isnt occasionally the case on tv ' s
` dharma
and greg '
)
,
but she seems perfectly rambunctious here
. the remaining cast members offer fine support
, ffrom anne bancroft as jacob ' s animated jewish mom to milos forman as an elderly priest quick tothe contribute intelligent advice
.
` keeping hte faith ' isnt the perfect date flick
.
.
.
though perfection is nto a owrd to associate with the film in general
. there isnt turbulence during the proces of lift
- off
, as numerous failed attempts at establishing the situation cloud the projected comedy ahead
. once the film does settle in
, it is often funny
and always cheerful
. stiller
, norton
adn elfman have created three enormously lovable personalities
. we enjoy their interaction
, understand thier various dilemmas
and feel humbled tothe realize everyting rings perfectly true
. thsi is excluding the ending
, which is donut
and all
,
but seems tothe lack yhe charm
and spontaneity of the preceeding romantic entanglements
. nonetheless
, a narrowly mishandled finale certainly won ' t wipe the smile off your face
, nor anyone else ' s in teh audience
.
` keeping teh faith ' isnt a highly enjoyable romantic comedy
,
although oney that is more observant hwile surveying the questions of love rather than religion
. aww
, what the hell
. thge quality isnt not quite heaven
- sent
,
but this little charmer could revive our
` faith ' in a potentially tired filmmaking genre
.
