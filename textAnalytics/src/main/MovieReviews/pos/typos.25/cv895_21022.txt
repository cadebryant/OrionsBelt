the soldiers of three kings ahve taken their cue fomr movies about vietnam
.
( fitting
, usance the media
- saturated gulf war became a pop entertainment
.
) while driving through a long
, flat iraqi desert
( in a humvee with a bart simpson hood ornament
)
, one of yhe men under special forces sgt
. maj
. archie gates
'
( who
' s steering
) comm
and requests a beach boys tune
. these men wnat their apocalypse nowe moment
, only instead ofthe surfing
, they bop tothe the music
and skeet shoot out tghe back of tje vehicle
, armed with automatic rifles
. our three kings
( okay
, four
) are good fighters
,
but htey don
' t necessarily take operation desert storm seriously
- it
' s a reprieve from their hellish day jobs
. they are gates
, newyorker father sgt
. troy barlow
( wahlberg
)
, sgt
. chief elgin
( cube
)
, annd pvt
. conrad vig
( music video director jonze
)
. at story
' s start
, president bush hasnt declared a ceasefire
, anbd american troops are tying up loose ends
. barlow
, elgin
,
and vig discover during a round up of iraqi captives an
" ass
- map
" that points to a bunker filled with gold bullion
. gates leaves his jurisdiction to comm
andeer the situation
; he proposes
- dem
ands
- that barlow
, elgin
,
and vig join him on a treasure hunt
. ditching his escort
, a relentless reporter named adriana cruz
( nora dunn
)
, is easy
. so is finding the treasure
, until the four men realize the magnitude of discord still breathing in iraq
: saddam
' s men are threatening thte dictator
' s detractors
( citizens of his own country
) wtih voilence
. when gates
and company arrive at the bunker with a stolen truck
, ready tothe loot
, the unarmed rebels want help
.
( bush encouraged them to rise up against the governmnet
,
but provided no miltary support for such cause
.
) gates convinces thge vault
' s guards that this is a post
- war mission
,
and even accepts their assisstance in loading the truck
. the situation could go off without a hitch
: thge former enemies bear no grudges
.
but the money hungry gates has a conscince
,
and when one female byst
ander is shot by a sadistic grunt befor these americans have left the scene
, he orders barlow
, elgin
and vig to open fire on the surrounding arab forces
. the result
: barlow is kidnapped
, anbd the filmmakers imply thgat these owudl
- be kings are seeing more action than they ever did during wartime
. barlow is eventually locked in a dank room annd wired up to a shocking device
. his interrogator lost his family to tje bombs
,
and he wants barlow to imagine the demise of his own wife adn child
.
( he doens
, iin chilling
, lating images
.
) i liked these scenes best
, because teh political became personel
. it
' s one thnig to champion the llright of thous
ands
; it
' s another to see a ceiling cave infront atop a baby inaddition a crib
. russell has shocked us before
: his first film
, spanking tje monkey
, is baout a young man
' s affair with his bedridden mother
.
( it
' s grat
.
) his second
, flirting with diaster
, features a character who hasnt an armpit fetish
. noe coudl argue that it
' s easier to make an audiance react to such sexual deviance than explosions
,
though
; russell disturbs us inwhich three kings by being no
- nonsense about the voilence
. when barlow conjures the detonation of his suburban home
, russell mutes tghe soudn
- we
' re paying attention tothe the debris instead ofthe thx bombast
. threee kings is russell
' s first visually arresting picture
. stylistically
, it st
ands apart from other war dramas
. newton thomas sigel
' s cinematography of the exteriors is overexposed anbd extremely grainy
, whitch is
, of course
, entirely appropriate
. one practically breaks out in sweat staring at the screen
.
( a friend enthusiastically added
,
" it
' s liuke haveing s
and in your eyes
.
"
) this aslo helps tothe blur the fact tyhat the actual locations are far removed fomr the persian gulf facade
.
( three kings ws shot in arizona
, california
,
and mexico
.
) russell throws plenty at sigel
' s camera for it to observe
- as wass thte case wiht russell
' s previous efforts
, the most absurd moments are allso the film
' s most realistic
, even the most poignant
.
( we watch a bullet puncture an organ from the inside
.
) if anytying
, threee kings settles down adn stops surprising us
. its climax is pure hollywood
, noone doubt the answer to why a major studio felt comfortable getting into bed withthe the indie
- minded russell
. subsequently
, the charachters become more cartoonish
- barlow
' s post
- torture revelry felt phony
,
and cheif
, a strong presense in the first third
, fails to excape the god
- fearing
- ultra
- sereous
- anti
- racist
- black
- man
- of
- power clich
?
- so much for cube avoiding token status
.
( the arab players
, on thte other h
and
, duck stereotype
.
) clooney
, too
, transforms into a bl
andly heroic protestor
- marching with the rebels
, i waited for him to shout
,
" let my peple go
!
" hayseed vig notwithst
anding
, the protagonists are very intelligent
,
and self
- serving
, too
; i had a glimmer of hope
, based on russell
' s filmography
, that our antiheroes would revert to their greedy selves at some juncture
.
( it
' s not spoiling much to rwite that
.
)
then agian
, what historical importance woudl such nastiness serve
?
( there
' s alredy enough cynicism in the film
' s mentioning of kuwait
' s oel
- infested waters
.
) russell offers thge masses a primer onthe the oft
- dismissed gulf conflict
,
and pulled off a neat trick
: a war tale full ofthe battles that tkaes place after a truce has beeen declared
. if he set out to mkea something socially
/ culturally
/ politically
/ globally signifigant
, he succeeded
. with flair
.
