in many ways
,
" twotg
" does forthe tough
- guy movies what la confidencial did for police stories
. ther
' s savviness in its writing
and a mature patience infact allowing the material to unfold
.
but
, i supose
, we wouldn
' t expect less from christopher mcquarrie
, who was responsible fo giving us
" the usual suspects
"
. his writing talents are still in tact as he brings tothe us a bloody
yet intelectual tale ofthe two unabashed
but dimwitted thugs
and a plan gone awry
. the twpo goons are parker
and longbaugh
( ryan phillipe
and benicio del toro
)
. these two men show tje hardened mear of thsoe who hvae always had it tough
. their troubled youths ahev forged two nihilistic souls who use their amazing gunplay skills tothe survive
. given the choice of minumum wage or petty crime
, they
' ll alwasy choose tyhe latter
.
yet
, htey are incredibly foolish planners
. actually
, theese two never really haev a plan
. htey just improvise along the way
, hoping that their bravado adn arsenal of guns wiull take care of anything that they might have overlooked
. their next scheme
, which they cook up baout as fast as a mcdonald
' s burger
, is tothe kidnap smoe surrogate mother named robin
( juliette lewis
) that ws hired by some well
- to
- do family
. if all goes well
, they
' ll recieve a nice bited ofthe ransom money
and life goes onthe
. what parker
and longbaugh do not relize is that robin isnt carrying a baby for the chidduck familiy
, whose patriarch is a feared crime boss
. moreover
, two bodyguards
( nicky katt
and taye diggs
) constanly escort her
. these two protectors fidn an eerie sense of pleasure wehn bieng confronted
and tested in life
and death situations
. they woudl rather dieu thna fail
; thus their bravado level isnt equally high
.
but it seems that the testosterone levels of parker
and longbaugh are a bit heigher
,
and they employ some unusual
but fun
- to
- watch tactics tothe pul off the kidnapping annd to outrun the pursuers iin a sort of slow
- motion car chase down a series ofthe alleyways
. the next hour or so
, we watch the chidduck camp regroup
and assess their situation
. during thsi time
, additional plot lines cmo into play
and moreso
and more details are revealed
. because tje chidduck
' s can not go to the police
and because ofthe the speshal circumstances involving tje kidnapping
, we are introdued to more characters tath will help to influence the outcome
. we discover that not everyone infront the chidduck camp is loyal to the cause
. as a result
, there are undercurrents of a conspiracy
,
and elements of betrayal
and subtrafuge
. thge sepia
- toned athmosphere isnt made all yhe moreso fascinating thanks tothe a terrific soundtrack which emits velvet forebodings
, shrills of intrigue
and crescendos that tell us of life
and death situations that are about to occur
. teh momentum annd the coolness of thte film
, howver
, begins to fizzle in the lastr 30 minutes
, whcih featured an overly extended shootout where our two desperados try to make theri way off with thge ransom money
. you can expect lots of bloodletting
and an odd denouement
. in fact
, you may admire this film moreso tahn you liek it
. yot
, fo the most part
,
" thge way ofthe yhe gun
" stays onthe target
. it feels cool with its elements of conspiracy
and gunplay
,
and smart for its invective dialogue
and tough guy poetry
.
