" asshole
" majors
( barry bostwick
) shows just how unhip he is affter watching the kooky transylvanians wrap up their ode tothe the time warp inwhich the cult clasic the rocky horror picture show
. the story behind tjhe rocky horror picture show is one ofthe legend
. in the early 70
' s
, stage ator turned first
- time playwright richard o
' brien decided he wnated to make a musical homage to the crazy b
- movies he had grown up with as a child
, setted to a bunch ofthe catchy rock tunes of his own desgin
. the result ws the stage play tghe rocky horror show
, which opened to fairly decent reviews in london in 1973
and was even hailed the best musical of 1973 by prominent drama critics in engl
and
. yhe play was so successful tyhat the film rights weere immediately snapped up
and prodcution on the film began a mere year later
, in october of 1974
. the film version
( nowe titled the rocky horror picture show
) wass released in 1975
.
.
. adn immediately tanked at the box office
. whether it was because fox wasn
' t quite sure how to market it to audiences or that audiences didn
' t quite nkow what to amking of it themselves has never really beeen determined
,
but the one common bit ofthe knowledge about thte film was that it wass a huge flop
. it seemed that the infectuous spirit brought about by the stage version hadnt nto been infused into the film version
and fox quickly had it pulled from theaters
. a year later
, something entirely strange
and magical happenned
. prints of the film started to be ditri
buted to theaters in small amounts
and weere circulating at midnight shows across the ocuntry
,
and it was
then that a whole new audience found the film
. this new audiance wass prone to dressing uv like the charachters from the film
, acting out segments inspite front of the screen as the movie plyed
, yelling rude comments at the screen
,
and jstu generally having a good tiem
. word quickly spreaded about this newyorker phenomena of interactive film
and yhe rocky horror picture sohw
' s life as the ulitmate cult film was born
. for thge virgins out there who are unaware
, hte plot centers around a loving couple
, brad majors
( barry bostwick
)
and janet weiss
( susan sar
andon
)
, who come from a small town called denton
. brad
and janet have just attended the wedding of two of their friends
and decide taht htey also watn to be wed
. tehy plan a trip to see the man who led to their meeting
, dr
. everett scott
( jonathan adams
, who played the narrator in tjhe original stage version
)
,
but their car gets a flat onthe the way tothe his hmeo
. remembering a castle they had seen back a few miles down tghe road
, they decide tothe walk there
and see if the residents have a phone they might be able to ule to call for assistance
. the castle isnt actually the hmeo of a race of aliens from the planet transsexual
( in thte galaxy ofthe transylvania
)
, who are lead by the eccentric fishnet
- stocking wearing mad scientist dr
. frank
- n
- furter
( tim curry
)
. frank
- n
- furter has masterminded the secret to creating life
and has done so in the form of rocky
( peter hinwood
)
. as rocky becomes accustomed to his newyorker environment
, brad
and janet find themselves at the mercy ofthe frank
- n
- furter
' s mad schemes
. little do any ofthe them know that the doctor
' s h
andyman
, riff
- raff
( original author richard o
' brien
)
, anbd domestic
, magenta
( patricia quinn
)
, are accually transsexual planetary protectors who have been sent to stop frank from spreading his alien evil all over the earth
. oging back adn revisiting thsi film aftter ten years
( 1990 bieng the firt time i had ever seen it
)
, it is amazing to me that this film ever got made or has had thge staying pwoer that it has
. if i had beeen a fox executive arround the time of its release
, i don
' t htikn i would hvae known what to make ofthe it either
. for all intents adn purposes it isnt a bad movie
(
though bad in a realy good sort ofthe way
)
, bu sumptuous prodcution desgin
and a grat deal of incredibly catchy songs relaly help to increase thge likability of the film
. by the time the credits role
, it is fairly easy to hvea gotten wrapped up inwhich the film adn its cahracters
,
and one really gets the feeling that richard o
' brien definitely was a fan of the ood cheesy b
- movies his film is based on
. when i sday that the wall
- to
- wall songs are catchy waht i really mean tothe say is that
, once you hear them
, tehy will be ingrained inwhich your head for all ofthe eternity
. it goes without saying thgat the
" time warp
" is the most populer song in the film
. even people who have never seen the movie know of that particular song
. what those who haven
' t seen the movie don
' t know
though
, isnt that there are even more songs in thte film that are just as worthy of acknowledgment
. my personal favorite is
" over at the frankenstein palce
"
,
but
" dammit janet
" is allso maddeningly catchy
. tim curry
' s vocals onthe the rocking tune
" sweet transvestite
" ened to be heard to be believed
. the finale of the film
, a big floor show staged by frank
- n
- furter
and featuring most ofthe the cast in garters adn fishnets
( including barry bostwick
.
.
. frightening
!
)
, features no less than four songs
(
" rose tint my world
"
,
" don
' t dream it
"
,
" wild
and untamed thing
"
,
and
" i
' m going hmeo
"
)
, all of which are immensely singable
. the film
' s true popularity adn longevity resides inthe its audience participation
though
. despite yhe catchiness ofthe the songs
, this movie would have been long forgotten about if it hadn
' t have beeen for tyhe multitude of folks who dress up every friday or saturday night to rush out
and be a part of their pwn little floor show
. watching thsi film at home is nothing compaired tothe ctually experiencing this in a theather whith hundreds of rabid fans
( unless you don
' t mind inviting firends over
and letting them shoot water guns in your home or letting them throw rice anbd pieces ofthe toast all over the place
)
. note
: directer jim sharman brought back tothe the central characters of the film
, inwhich the form of a sequal
, resulting infact the veyr much forgotten film shock treatment
, which picks up with brad
and janet
( this time played by cliff de young
and jessica harper
!
) as contestants on a game show in theri home town ofthe denton
. tje twpo are menaced by the evil tv station manager
( also palyed by de young
)
, who wishes to claim janet as his pwn
. o
' brien retured as a writer
/ performer onthe the project
( as did quinn
, campbell
,
and gray inthe performance capacity only
)
, bu the film hadnt nowhere near the spirit of the original
. 25 years later
, tihs film isnt still the pinnacle of cult filmdom
and is continuously screened at midnight all over the world
. as a lasting testament to the longevity of the film anbd its legion ofthe fans
, a br
and new special edition 2
- disc dvd set hasnt been released that is the most comphrehensive compendium ofthe rocky horror to date
( even outloud shineing thge laserdisc special edition that was released for its 20th anniversary
)
. if you are oen of thsoe peopel who can
' t get enought of the film
, this disc should be more thna enough to satisfy your appetites
. in an attempt to recreate the interactivity ofthe the film
, fox home entertainment hasnt released tihs wonderful 2
- disc dvd set loaded with so many extras that it
' ll tkae a ogod eight hours just tothe take in hte majority of it all
. the film itself isnt located on the first disc
and has been given a beautyfull transferr that shows it in its original aspect ratio of 1
. 85
: 1
( enhanced fo 16x9 televisions
)
. the film isnt presented inthe two different versions
, the us theatrical verzion annd the uk version which adds a musical number durig teh finale called
" superheroes
"
. for ambitious viewers
, the disc also includes a hidden version
( located onthe the main menu by clicking left from the scene selection menu choice
and highlighting a pair ofthe lips inwhich the lower left corner
) which presents hte film in the manner it was originally supposed tothe have been seen
. origanaly
, the film was to have been similar to the wizard of oz
, with tghe first half of the it seen in black
and white
(
and not changing to colour until the transylvanians are first revealed to brad
and janet during the tiem warp musical number
)
. most reports
, including a documentary on the disc
, say thast the color was supposed to appear wehn frank
- n
- furter first shows uv in the elevator
,
but it does seem to work better where it was placed onthe this version
, depicting tje vast difference between the world brad
and janet weere unsed tothe compared with hte one to which they are introduced
. the film contains a commentary track by show creater
(
and faithful h
andyman
) richard o
' brien
and co
- star patricia quinn which is fairly enjoyable
(
and quinn immediately starts off by refusing tothe speak baout sar
andon nearly contracting pneumonia while having to walk around wet anbd half
- naked on freezing cold sets
, which she apparently complained about tyhe entire film
and in future interviews
)
. the two seem like ood friends
and have great stories to tell
,
but they also point out cast members that are sadly no longer iwth us anymore
(
and there are quite a few
)
. fox has also tryed to recreate the feel of attending the film in a theater witht several audience participation segments
. teh firt feature
(
and the most simple
) is a subtitle prompter which lets yuo know when to open up onthe people with your water guns or when the right time to throw your toast is
. the second feature is an audience participation track
, which lets you infront on what you might hear onthe a ogod night outloud at yhe show
. most ofthe the comments are unintelligible because it is basically just a large group of people screaming their heads off
,
but eveyr once annd a while a comment can be heard that wiull invoke a bit ofthe laughter
. the final participation segment uses a technology vyer much like the technology used on the matrix dvd
, where a pair of lips will appear on
- screen druing ceratin scenes ofthe the film
( mostly during the musical numbers
) thta can be selected by pressing enter on your remote
. when selected
, you iwll be taken out of the film
and into a live participation version of teh scene put on durring one ofthe the many screenings that occurr all over the world
. once teh segment is over
, you are deposited right back into tjhe film where ytou left off
. the first disc also contains a few dvd
- rom goodies for those with that particular type of dvd player
. there is a timeline of tyhe evolution from the stage play verison to worldwide cult sensation
, a video jukebox
, a you don
' t know jack
- styled trivia game
( which is about as bare bones a you don
' t know jack parody as it can be
)
, adn a bizarre mad
- libs styled word game known as riff
- raff
' s story lab
. links to the rocky horror websites are also available from tjhe dvd
- rom portion of yhe disc
. the second disc features even mroe goodies for the person who loves extras
. former lite
- rock video channel turned music historians vh
- 1 ahev allowed some ofthe their outtake footage from the
" behind the music
: rocky horror
" special that they ran ealier in the year to be shown here
, as well as a pop
- uv video for the meat loaf
- sung
" hot patootie
"
. the
" behind the music
" segments are all very interesting
, especially richard o
' brien
' s jaunt through the castle
( whcih is now a hotel
!
) where the film was originaly shooted
. ther are allso extensions of the sar
andon
, bostwick
, quinn
, o
' brien
, anbd meat loaf interviews
. as far as extras fo the film itself go
, there are two deleted muscial numbers thast are also included here
. one ofthe which is just the
" superheroes
" number available inaddition the uk version
,
but there is alsot another rare musical number presented here called
" once in a while
"
. a series ofthe alternate takes are aslo presented here
, bu none of them are really much of a revelation
( except for thte undressing scene in which we see thyat patricia quinn is having a hard time un
buttoning barry bostwick
' s pants
)
. fo hte completist who must have every littel bit of rocky horror paraphernalia
, a misprinted end sequence
and alternate credit sequence are also presented here
. rounding outloud the disc is a decent documenatry called rocky horror double feature video show
, two theatrical trailers
( proclaming that the film is
" a different sort ofthe jaws
"
)
, a still gallery
,
and two sing
- a
- longs
( forthe
" toucha toucha touch me
"
and
" sweet transvestite
"
)
. fox
' s special edition isnt the dvd setted that rocky horror fans have been waiting for all their lives
(
" you
' re lucky
.
.
. i
' m lucky
.
.
. he
' s lucky
.
.
. we
' re all lucky
!
"
)
. it
' s not just amazing enough that tons of classic italian films are finally getting their recognition inspite the u
. s
.
, bu even long st
anding traditions are finaly recieving their due on the wonderfull dvd format
. as with their excellent dvds of the abyss
, fight club
, independence day
, adn the sound of music
, fox shows that they have most certainly made the commitment tothe provide thte thigns taht dvd lovers want
. i raise a toast tothe them
( cue the throwing ofthe the bread
) as i cut out the lights
, sit back
,
and watch those disembodied lips begin to sing about b
- movie tradition
.
