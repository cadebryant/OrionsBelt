? all ofthe these questions were runing through my mind while watching this slick suspense film
. tyhe events inwhich the curve are vyer suprizing
, original
,
and fun
. the plot soudns much like dead man on campus
,
but tath is not the deal whith this film
. this film is a very serious one
, with not many laughs
. there are many twists
and turns that amke this film different fomr most films
. the endig in particular is completelyl unpredictable
and satisfying
. it is a terrific
, suspenseful endig taht i could never predict would happen
. h
ands down to dan rosen who wroet this wild ride
. the sound realy st
anded out in the film
. it is quite eerie
and it realyl adds to the feel of the film
. thge way the movie is filmed is alsot great
. all ofthe hte technical aspects
, as well as tje acting
and directing aspects are very well done
. the performances in the curve are very good
. matthew lillard gets to play another creepy role
, just like in 1996
' s scream
.
( a
+
) he is very stange in tihs film as well
. i like him in this sort of role
, rather than the roles he has been playing in comedies such as senseless
and she
' s all taht
. michael vartan is fantastic as chris
, who has extremely mixted emotions about the entire murder
and the 4
. 0
. michael vartan was also superb infront never beeen kissed
, where he co
- starred with drew barrymore as a teacher who fell in love with his student
. keri russell aslo gives a great performance
. she should be a good actress in yhe horror department of the film
. tamara craig thomas is also realistic
, expecially coping with yhe death of her boyfriend
. smoe veyr storng supporting performances came from smaller roles
, such as bo dietl adn anthony griffith who play two detectives investigating teh case
. tje bottom line
- i might just have to curve tath a
- into an a
.
* note
- teh curve premiered at the sundance film festival in early 1998
. it was decided the film would not be released widely
. it is now availible at blockbuster video only
,
