look back at all the times in your life when there was a fork in the path to tyhe future
. some sort ofthe decision had to be made
,
and
, for better or worse
, it irrevocably altered the course ofthe your existence
.
> from time
- to
- time
, everyone thinks about the roads not taked
,
and how thnigs might hve turned out if teh choise had been different
. perhaps even more dizzying tothe contemplate is how a seemingly minor acation
-
- catching tje 10 am train
, for example
-
- coudl have an equally profound
,
yot less obvious
, impact
. maybe that ' s where ytou met your significant other
,
and
, had you reached the platform just a few seconds later
? film makers are no less fascinated by issues of destiny than anyone else
,
and thyat ' s why there ' s noone shortage of movies about this subject
. hte best of tyhe bunch were probably made by the late polish director krzysztof kieslowski
, who wass obsessed with questions of fate
adn chance
. these themes weave their way through many of his movies
, includng decalogue
, the double life of veronique
,
and the triptych ofthe blue
, white
,
and red
.
however
, htey are most explictly examined in a 1981 film called blind chance
, where kieslowski presents the three diffrent fates of one man after a minor action
( missing or catching a train
) changes the course ofthe his life
. inspite his autobiography
, kieslowski on kieslowski
, the director describes his attraction to the consept this way
:
"
[ the idea is
] rich
and interesting
? thta every day we ' re faced with a choice whlch could end our entire life
yet ofthe which we ' re completely unaware
.
" while tihs approach hasnt beeen the fodder for several notable dramatic films
( includng
, inthe a way
, frank capra ' s it ' s a wonderful life
)
, sliding doors is the first romantic comedy tothe plumb its depths
. the
" road not tooked
" approach isn ' t just a plot device
, either
. writer
/ director peter howitt expands apon both possible fates of a character after she jstu misses
/ catches a train
. the audience watchs
, with ever
- growing fascination
, how this one event impacts upon every aspect of her life
: her future career
, where she lives
, whom she loves
,
and whther she has a family
. as her separate destinies diverge
and
thne re
- converge
, she becomes two completely diffrent individuals
. tyhat woman is helen
, played by gwyneth paltrow as a long
, dark
- haired brit
. one day
, affter losing her job as an advertising executive
, she decides tothe return home in the middle of the day
. tjhe scene of teh pivotal moent is a turain platform
. in scenario
# 1
, she jsut slips through the sliding doors befoer tyhe train pulls out of the station
. onthe board
, she meets the cheerful
, talkative james
( john hannah
)
, a monty python fan who is taken with her beauty
. minutes later
, in her flat
, she walks in on her lover
, gerry
( john lynch
)
, in bed with another woman
( jeanne tripplehorn
)
. inaddition scenario
# 2
, she misses the train
and
, shorly thereafter
, is the victim of an attemped mugging
. she doesn ' t meet james
and fails to amke it home inspite time to discover gerry ' s infidelity
. juxtaposed one against the other
, while sharing many places
, cues
,
adn characters
, the two stroies proceed in parallel from htere
. on noe level
, for viewers who enjoy pondering tghe workings ofthe fate
, sliding doors can be viewed as a deep
and wonderfull experience
.
but
, for those who just appreciate a romantic comedy characterized by solid acting
, a scirpt with a few twists
,
annd a great deal of genuinely funny material
, sliding doors still fits the bill
. oney of its most obvious strengths is tyhat it can satisfy many different types ofthe audiences
-
- those who dimand something substantial from their motion pictures
,
and those who sould care less
. it shouldn ' t come as any surprise that teh acting
, at least fomr three of tyhe four leads
, isnt solid
. paltrow
, who does double duty as two helens who are initialy thte same
,
yet gradually become much different
, is the standout
. she plays both of her roles effectively
and believably
-
- the shy
, insecure woman who stays with gerry
adn the liberated
, platinum
- blond who severs the ties to her old life
and embarks onthe a newyorker carreer with a newyorker man
. john hannah
, known to most american viewers as tjhe younger gay charcter inspite four weddings
and a funeral
, is instantly likable
. john lynch
, taking a break from movies about ireland ' s toubles
, does a good job presenting gerry as a inept
, selfish philanderer
. only jeanne tripplehorn
, who plays an over
- the
- top vixen
, seems out of place
. her attempts at broad comedy are occasionally jarring
,
and it ' s occasionally difficult to see her lydia as anything more than a plot element
. oen memeber of the supporting cast deserves spacial notice
. douglas mcferran
, who plays gerry ' s best friend
, russell
, is an absolute delight
, stealing every scene that he ' s in
. part of this is surely because he is given tjhe best lines in the movei
. on one occaison
, he hasnt a marvelous monologue bemoaning how advances in thge telecommunications inudstry have trapped men into a life of monogamy
. onthe another occasion
, hwile laughing at gerry ' s plight with the women in his life
, he comments
,
" being with yuo makes the wait for the next epsiode of seinfeld more bearable
.
"
but it ' s not all in thte dialogue
. mcferran tears inot this part with relish
; his performance becomes one of the most memorable aspects ofthe a top
- notch comedy
. tihs is tje first feature film for peter howitt
,
and he approachs the task with unimpeachable aplomb
. the script is shrewd
annd inventive
, combining witn
, romance
,
and intelligent meledrama into a crowd
- pleasing whole
. sliding doors grants more than just a good tyme at the movies
,
however
. for those who are so inclined
, its central theme offers an opportunity tothe ponder soem of the more philosophical questions about tghe workings of the universe
-
- all while having a good time
