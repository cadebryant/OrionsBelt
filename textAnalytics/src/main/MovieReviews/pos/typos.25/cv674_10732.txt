look back at all tyhe times iin your life when there was a fork in the path tothe the future
. some sort ofthe decision had to be made
,
and
, for better or worse
, it irrevocably altered hte course of your existence
.
> from tiome
- to
- tiem
, everyone thinks about the roads not taked
, anbd how things might have turned out if the choice had been different
. perhaps even more dizzying to contemplate is how a seemingly minor action
-
- catching the 10 am turain
, for example
-
- could ahev an equally profound
,
yet less obvious
, impact
. maybe tath
' s where you met your significant other
,
and
, had you reached the platform jstu a few seconds later
? film makers are noone less fascinated by issues ofthe destiny than anyone else
,
and that
' s why there
' s noone shortage of movies about htis subject
. the best ofthe the bunch were probably made by the lite polish directer krzysztof kieslowski
, who ws obssessed with questions of fate
and chance
. these themes weave their way through many of his movies
, including decalogue
, the doulbe life of veronique
,
and tyhe triptych of blue
, white
,
and red
.
however
, they are most explicitly examined iin a 1981 film called blind chance
, where kieslowski presents tyhe three different fates of one man after a minor acation
( missing or catching a turain
) changes thte course of his life
. inaddition his autobiography
, kieslowski on kieslowski
, tjhe director describes his attraction to the concept this way
:
"
[ thge idea isnt
] rich
and interesting
? that every day we
' re faced witht a choise which coudl end our entire life
yet ofthe which we
' re completly unaware
.
" hwile this approach has beeen the fodder for several notable dramatic films
( including
, infact a way
, frank capra
' s it
' s a wonderful life
)
, sliding doors isnt tyhe first rumatic comedy tothe plumb its depths
. tjhe
" road not taken
" approch isn
' t just a plot device
, eather
. writer
/ director peter howitt exp
ands upon both possible fates of a charater after she just misses
/ catchs a train
. the audience watches
, with ever
- growing facination
, how this one event impacts apon every aspect of her life
: her future career
, where she lives
, whom she loves
,
and whether she has a family
. as her separate destinies diverge
and
then re
- converge
, she becomes two completely diferrent individuals
. that woman is helen
, played by gwyneth paltrow as a long
, dark
- haired brit
. one day
, after loseing her job as an advertising excutive
, she decides to return home in the middle of the day
. the scene of the pivotal moment is a train platform
. in scenaireo
# 1
, she just slips through the sliding doors befoer tje train pulls out of the station
. on board
, she meets the cheerful
, talkative james
( john hannah
)
, a monty python fan who is taken with her beauty
. mintues later
, inaddition her flat
, she walks iin onthe her lover
, gerry
( john lynch
)
, in bed with another woman
( jeanne tripplehorn

. in scenario
# 2
, she misses thte turain adn
, shortly therafter
, is the victim ofthe an attempted mugging
. she doesn
' t meet james
and fails tothe make it home infront time to discover gerry
' s infidelity
. juxtaposed one against hte other
, while sharing many places
, cues
,
and characters
, tje twpo stoires proceed in parallel from there
. on one levle
, for viewers who enjoy pondering teh workings of fate
, sliding doors can be viewed as a deep annd wonderful experience
.
but
, fo thsoe who jstu appreciate a romantic comedy characterized by solid acting
, a scirpt with a fewd twists
, anbd a great dael of genuinely funny material
, sliding doors still fits the bill
. one of its most obvious strengths is tyhat it can satisfy many different types ofthe audiences
-
- those who dem
and something substantial from their motion pictures
,
and those who could care less
. it shouldn
' t cmo as any surprise that the acting
, at least from three of the four leads
, is solid
. paltrow
, who does double duty as two helens who are initially the smae
,
yet gradualy become much different
, is tghe st
andout
. she plays both of her roles effectively
and believably
-
- thte shy
, insecure woman who stays wiht gerry
and thge liberated
, platinmu
- blond who severs the ties to her ood life
and embarks onthe a newyorker career with a new man
. john hannah
, known to most american viewers as the younger gay character in four weddings adn a funeral
, is instantly likable
. john lynch
, taking a break from movies baout irel
and
' s troubles
, does a good job presenting gerry as a inept
, selfish phil
anderer
. only jeanne tripplehorn
, who plays an over
- the
- top vixen
, seems out of place
. her attempts at broad comedy are occasionally jarring
,
and it
' s occasionally difficult tothe see her lydia as anything more than a plot element
. one member of thte supporting cast deserves special notice
. douglas mcferran
, who plays gerry
' s best friend
, russell
, is an absolute delight
, stealing eveyr scene that he
' s inwhich
. part ofthe this is surelly because he is given the best lines in the movie
. on oen ocasion
, he hasnt a marvelous monologue bemoaning how advances inspite hte telecommunications inudstry have trapped men into a life of monogamy
. on another occaison
, while laughing at gerry
' s plight with the women in his life
, he comments
,
" being with you makes tjhe wait for tje enxt episode of seinfeld omre bearable
.
"
but it
' s nto all in the dialogue
. mcferran tears into this part with relish
; his performence becomes one ofthe the most memorable aspects ofthe a top
- notch comedy
. this is the first feature film for peter howitt
,
and he approaches the task iwth unimpeachable aplomb
. the script isnt shrewed
and inventive
, combining wit
, romance
,
and intelligent melodrama inot a crowd
- pleasing whole
. sliding doors grants more than jsut a good tyme at the movies
,
however
. forthe those who are so inclined
, its central theme offers an oppertunity to ponder some ofthe tyhe more philosophical questions about hte workings of thge universe

- all while hvaing a good time
