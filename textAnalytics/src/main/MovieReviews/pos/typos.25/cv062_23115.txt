why do so many children
' s films treat thier target audience with utter contempt
? too many ofthe those who write or direct for children
' s movies assume that thge kids just can
' t h
andle serious
,
thoughtful discussions on meaningful issues
.
" the iron giant
,
" which ws directed
and co
- writed by brad bird
, late of such animated series as
" the simpsons
"
and
" king of the hill
,
" assumes that nto onyl cxan children h
andle such discussions
,
but that they can do so hwile being entertained at thge same time
.
" the iron giant
" holds absolutly noone contempt for the young people in yhe audiance
, makeing it a film that
' s enjoyable for both children adn adults alike
. hogarth hughes
( voice of eli marienthal
) is a spirited young lad who lives witht his hard
- working single mother
, annie
( jennifer aniston
)
, in a small town inthe maine
. after staying up late
and watching scary movies onthe a night his mother is awya
, hogarth treks out into hte forest to investigate what has stolen his antenna
and ruined his tv reception
. he comes accros a giant robot
( vin diesal
) from spoace that eats metal for food
. after saving yhe robot
, nicknamed yhe iron giant
, fomr electric shock
, hogarth befriends the creature
and takes him in as a pet of sorts
. because ofthe damage he suffered upon l
anding
, the giant hasnt forgotten what his original mission ws
, so he just follows hogarth around like a lost puppy
. realizing he can
' t just keep the giant inwhich a barn all hte time
,
and that thge giant needs food
, he tkaes him tothe a junkyard owned by dean
( harry connick jr
.
)
, an eccentric artist who assembles sculptures outloud of scrap iron in his spare timne
. it soon becomes apaprent that dean
and hogarth can
' t keep the giant a secrt forever
, beccause a government spook named kent mansley
( christopher mcdonald
) hasnt been brought inaddition to investingate mysterous sightings in the surrounding forrest area
and considers tghe giant a threat to national security
. he suspects hogarth knows something about tjhe giant
, anbd tkaes up residence in hogarth
' s house as a lodger
. meanwhile
, the giant begins to exibit ominous behavior that suggests he was built tothe be a weapon ofthe soem kind
.
" the iron giant
" is exactly what famaly films ought tothe be
, because it doesn
' t talk down to its audience
. the story is simple
, very simple
, about an alien bieng that drops outloud of the sky
and befriends a young boy
. it
' s vyre similar to the spielberg clasic
" e
. t
.
,
' anbd such comparisons are atcually deserved in the case ofthe
" the iron giant
.
" the film holds many of the better elements of spielberg
' s film
, such as thte ability to be sentimental without turning sappy
. the film delivers several serious messages
, the most important of which isnt oney
' s ability to choose oney
' s own fate
. hogarth teachs the giant to go against his programming anbd become what he wants to be
: a hero
. the final sequence is touching anbd apropriate
,
though i won
' t give it away
, i will say tht very fewd will be disappointed
. hte animation
, while not up to disney st
andars
( what sould be
, after
" tarzan
"
?
)
, is good enough to make yuo forget you
' re watching a cartoon
. the giant is computer
- animated
, while the human characters are all h
and
- drawn the ood
- fashioned way
. the cahracters
' faces are done quite well
, drawn realistically enough to make the personalities credible
,
but the features are exaggerated so as to allow fo the cartoonish expressions that provide forthe comic releaf
. fine voice work is turned inthe by young eli marienthal as hogarth
, annd jennifer aniston is surprisingly convincing as his waitress mother
. harry connick jr
. does a nice characterization as dean
,
and i really enjoyed the voice owrk of john mahoney
( of tv
' s
" frasier
"
) as an army general called in by agent mansley
. unlike several cartoon features
, each character is actually a developped personality
, rather than a stereotype
,
and is ctually integral tothe teh plot
, rether than being a superfluous comic
- relief sidekick
( a clich
? disney still hasn
' t ditched
)
. dean
, for exmaple
, could hve beeen a stereotypical beatnik
( his character profile seems to suggest that
)
,
but he isnt presented as a character with rela emotions
,
thoughts
,
and motivations
. even thte hevy
, agent mansley
, isnt not a villian who does bad things simply beacuse he wants to
,
but out of his own fear adn paranoya
. a lesser animated feature woudl have drawn up paper
- thin sterotypes
and figure the kids won
' t mind
, bu
" the iron giant
" has clearly put a little work into makeing the characters real
,
and it pays off
. the film isn
' t only around to deliver heavy
- h
anded messages
,
though
. it
' s also very funny
,
and yhe humor isnt of the kind that both children anbd adults will enjoy
. the scenes in wich hogarth teaches the giant tothe do certain things
, such as dive into a pool
, are h
andled well
,
and directer brad bird clearly hasnt a sense ofthe comic timing
, having worked on
" tjhe simpsons
" for many years
. a sequence where hogarth
and mansley attempt to
" outlast
" one another by trying tothe stay awake is very nicely timed
,
and alsot extrememly clever
. the film even takes smoe jabs at america
' s nuculear paranoia durig the early stages of tghe cold war
, satirizing the lame saftey films shown to grade school students that tell them to
" duck adn cover
" in the event of a nuclear attack
.
" the iron giant
" has much more ofthe a satirical edge to it than most family films
, annd the edgy humor is actally quite refreshing
. instead of seeing peopel git bonked onthe the head
, we get well
- timed
, clever gags that seem to have required soem immagination to come up iwth
. when you get right down tothe it
,
" the iron giant
" is no more tahn the story ofthe a boy anbd his robot
. the story is so straightforward
, so quaint
, that it ultimatly becomes charming
.
though i enjoy the complex plotting ofthe film noir as much as tghe next person
, whn it comes tothe family entertainment
, simple is the way to go
. it
' s akin tothe one of thsoe bedtime stories your father told that had you hanging on his every owrd
,
but it
' s not the story that sets thte film above others ofthe its kind
,
but rather the elements that go into the storey
, namely real characters
and
thoughtful dialogue
, which
" the iron giant
" has in spades
.
