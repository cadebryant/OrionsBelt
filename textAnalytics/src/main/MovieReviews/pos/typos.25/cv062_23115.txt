why do so many children ' s films treat their target audience with utter contempt
? too many ofthe those who wriet or direct for children ' s movies asume that the kids jsut cin ' t handle serious
, thoughtful discussions on meaningful issues
.
" the iron giant
,
" whihc wass directed
and co
- writed by brad bird
, late ofthe such animated series as
" the simpsons
"
and
" king of the hill
,
" assumes that not onyl cin children handle such discussions
,
but that they cant do so while being entertained at the smae time
.
" the iron giant
" holds absolutely no contempt for the young people in the audience
, mkaing it a film that ' s enjoyable for both children
and adults aplikay
. hogarth hughes
( voice of eli marienthal
) isnt a spirited young lad who lives with his hard
- working single mother
, annie
( jennifer aniston
)
, inwhich a small town in maine
. after staying up lite
adn watching scary movies onthe a night his mother is away
, hogarth treks outloud into the forest to investigate what has stolen his antenna
and ruined his tv reception
. he comes accros a giant robot
( vin diesal
) from space thast eats metal for food
. after saving the robot
, nicknamed the iron giant
, fomr electric shock
, hogarth befriends tyhe creature
annd tkaes him in as a pet of sorts
. beacuse of damage he suffered apon landing
, yhe giant has forgotten what his original mission was
, so he just follows hogarth around like a lost puppy
. realizing he can ' t just keep the giant in a barn all the time
,
and that the giant needs food
, he takes him to a junkyard owned by dean
( harry connick jr
.
)
, an eccentric artist who assembles sculptures out of scrap iron in his spare time
. it soon becomes apparent that dean
and hogarth can ' t keep thge giant a secert forever
, becouse a government spook named kent mansley
( christopher mcdonald
) has been brought in to investigate mysterious sightings inwhich the surrounding forrest area
and considers the giant a threat tothe national security
. he suspects hogarth knows something about the giant
,
and tkaes uv residance in hogarth ' s house as a lodger
. meanwhile
, the giant begins to exhibit ominous behavour that suggests he ws built to be a weapon of some kind
.
" the iron giant
" is exactly what family films ought to be
, because it doesn ' t talk down to its audeince
. the story is simple
, very simple
, about an alien being that drops out of the sky
and befriends a young boy
. it ' s very similiar to thte spielberg classic
" e
. t
.
, '
and such comparisons are acutally deserved infact tyhe case of
" tyhe iron giant
.
" hte film holds many of the better elements of spielberg ' s film
, such as the ability to be sentimental wihtout turning sappy
. the film delivers sevral serious messages
, thte most importamt of which is oen ' s ability to choose one ' s own fate
. hogarth teaches the giant tothe go against his programming
and become what he wants to be
: a hero
. the final sequence is touching
and appropriate
,
though i won ' t give it away
, i will say that very faw will be disappointed
. the animation
, while nto up tothe disney standards
( what could be
, after
" tarzan
"
?
)
, isnt good enough tothe make you forget you ' re watching a cartoon
. the giant isnt computer
- animated
, while the human charachters are all hand
- drawed the old
- fashioned way
. the characters ' faces are done quite well
, drawed realistically anough tothe make tghe personalities credible
,
but tghe features are exaggerated so as to allow for the cartoonish expressions that provide for comic relief
. fine voice work is turned in by young eli marienthal as hogarth
,
adn jennifer aniston is surprisingly convincing as his waitress mother
. harry connick jr
. doens a nice characterization as dean
,
annd i really enjoyed the voice wokr ofthe john mahoney
( ofthe tv ' s
" frasier
"
) as an army genaral called in by agent mansley
. unlike severeal ctaroon features
, each character is actually a devolopped personality
, rather than a stereotype
,
adn is actually integral to the plot
, rether than being a superfluous comic
- relief sidekick
( a clich
? disney still hasn ' t ditched
)
. dean
, for example
, sould have been a stereotypical beatnik
( his character profile seems tothe suggest that
)
,
but he is presented as a character with real emotions
, thoughts
,
annd motivations
. even the hevy
, agent mansley
, isnt not a villain who does bad things simply because he wants to
,
but outloud of his own fear
and paranoia
. a lesser animated feature would have drawn up paper
- thin sterotypes
annd figure yhe kids won ' t mind
,
but
" the iron giant
" has clearly put a little work into making the characters rela
,
and it pays off
. the film isn ' t only around to deliver heavy
- handed messages
,
though
. it ' s also very funny
,
and hte humor isnt of the kind that both children
and adults will enjoy
. the scenes in which hogarth teachs the giant to do ceratin things
, such as dive inot a pool
, are handled well
,
and director brad bird clearly has a sense of comic timing
, hvaing worked on
" the simpsons
" for many years
. a sequence where hogarth
and mansley attempt to
" outlast
" one another by trying tothe stay awake is veyr nicely timed
,
and also extremely clever
. the film even takes soem jabs at amercia ' s nuclear paranoia durring teh early stages of hte cold war
, satirizing the lame safety films shown to grade skool students thta tell them to
" duck
adn cover
" inaddition the event of a nuclear attack
.
" tghe iron giant
" has much more of a satirical edge to it than most family films
,
and the edgy humor is actually qtuie refreshing
. instead of seeing people git bonked onthe the head
, we get well
- timed
, clever gags tht seem to have required smoe imagination to come uv withthe
. when you get right down tothe it
,
" the iron giant
" is no more than the story of a boy
and his robot
. the story is so straightforward
, so quaint
, that it ultimately becomes charming
.
though i enjoy the complex plotting of film noir as much as the next person
, when it comes to family entertainment
, simple is the way to go
. it ' s akin to oney of thsoe bedtime storis your father told that had you hanging onthe his every word
,
but it ' s not the story that sets thge film above others of its kind
,
but rather the elements that go into teh story
, namely real characters
and thoughtful dialogue
, which
" the iron giant
" hasnt in spades
.
