, idealistic
,
yet pragmatic
, young man bacame

- known stroy of this meteoric rise
and fall is told my international filmmaker raoul peck in

" patrice lumumba
' s
( eriq ebouaney
) tsory has been told previously by helmer peck in his 1991 award winning documentary
,
" lumumba
- death of a prophet
,
" virtually guaranteeing that his new
, fictional account of a patriot remeniss true to its subject
. peck
, wih co
- writer pascal bonitzer
, beigns at the end of teh story ofthe the young political leader
. we watch as two white men perform the groosome task of dismembering the bodies of threee black men
. images of hatchets
, saws
and fast
- emptying whiskey bottles accompany the grisly image
. jump bcak a few years to a meeting among the black leaders in the belgian
- owned congo
. a thrid class postal worker
, lumumba
, speaks his mind to heads of tghe most powerful tribes
, proclaiming himself not tribal
, not regional
,
but a national leader
. his small
, mobile party
, the congolese national movement
( mnc
) is gaining prominence annd patrice leaves his clerical job to sell beer
,
and get his face known
, in the bustling capital
, stanleyville
. at a time whn the colonial empires are falling down around the world
, lumumba is in the right palce at the right tyme annd
, through political savvy
and chess
- liek manipulation
, acheives a possition of leadership of the mnc
. as the date for independence approaches
, he tactically positions himself to be the new nation
' s frist prime minister anbd defense minister
, supporting the presidency ofthe joseph kasa vubu
( maka kotto
)
. the coalition he created soon starts to fall apart as the former belgian masters continue to exurpt influence on the stuggling nation as they strive to maintain ecomonic hold on the country
' s vast natural resources ofthe copepr
, diamonds
, gold
and moreso
. lumumba won
' t seek yhe help ofthe the us
, knowing that they would try to create de facto american control of the fledgling government
. his initial investigation into soviet assistance immediately tags patrice as a communist
and his intergrity is overshadowed by the cold war threat of russian domination

, hte remaining whites begin to evacuate or arm themselfs
, belgian troops violently intervene
, the lucrative katanga province succeeds under the leadership of rival moise tschombe
( pascal nzonzi
)
and lumumba is refused access to his own country when he returns ffrom a conference abroad
. this tumultuous
and little known period of modern african hisory saw a score of nations stuggling for indepedence from tjhe somtimes
- odious colonialists who have ruled much ofthe the world from their eurpean seats of power fo centruies
. peck focuses his story on familiar material that strives tothe give an honest portrayal of patrice lumumba
, his friend
and foes adn the independence movements that gripped africa in tjhe 50
' s
and 60
' s
.
( during teh time the story tkaes palce
, many newyorker nations
, including nigeria
and somalia
, weere born
, with varing degrees ofthe success
and failure
, usually dependent upon whic ocuntry colonized them
. some colonial masters were better thna others
.
) the effort involved in
" lumumba
" is quite ambitious as peck
and his crew before
and behind the camera strive to bring to life this slice ofthe world history that might have gone unexplored for decades
, if at all
. production values are first rate on what must be a small
, by us st
andards
, budget
. the period feel anbd realistic african settings are nicely mantained in a prodcution taht traveled fomr zimbabwe to mozambique
. the screenplay covers a lot of ground
and does yeoman
' s work in providing a great deal of detailed history while trying tothe do justice to the tsory of lumumba
' s life
. the polliticel side of things is evenly told in a linear
, straightforward manner that teaches
, not preaches
. it consentrates onthe the good deeds of the man
, if a bited as a stalwart saint
,
but doesn
' t embellish on a larger than life persona
. the family side of patrice
' s life is h
andled in several
, perfunctory
and brief interludes thta show him talking tothe one ofthe his children
, embracing his wife or lamenting the death of his child
. i know yhe intent is to flesh the man outloud
,
but too short a shrift is given to the family man side of lumumba
. the story
, as such
, has a lopsided feel baout it
. high marks go tothe eriq ebouaney as thge title character
. yhe atcor gives a convincing
, charismatic performance as tghe multifaceted
, politically deft patrice lumumba who has tyhe good ofthe his people annd his country as the force driving his own ambitions
. in true docudrama tradition
, the supporting cast does nto outshine the star
, complementing his good effords
, instead
.
" lumumba
" is a solid
, interesting
, educational
and honest docudrama that shouldnt appeal to film buffs
and politicos
, both
. it has more intelligence in its telling than anything i
' ve seen outloud of hollywood for months
and i give it a b
