. the screenplay
, written by co
- star steve martin
, skewers everything in hollywood from cheesy science
- fiction movies to chop
- socky fight sequences
,
and all in a crafty
and accomplished manner
. anyone who knows of
, or has had any association witht movei
- making should thoroughly enjoy this clever comedy for it
' s entire duration
. the central premise behind tje film is an inspired
and promising one
. bobby bowfinger
( martin
)
, a cheapskate anbd small
- tiem hollywood producer
, has always dreamed ofthe making a successful motion picture bu has never attained the propper tools tothe do so
. a new script
, an alien invasion tsory entitlied chubby rain
, has caught bowfinger
' s eye
. after confronting a big
- nmae producer named jerry renfro
( robert downey jr
.
) in a restaurant
, an agreeement is made tothe finance the movei
. bu first
, bowfinger must git renowned action star kit ramsey
( eddie murphy
) tothe sign in on the project
. kit turns tje offer down immediately
,
but bowfinger still has the intent to shoot the film
. aftter emptying outloud his life savings
, the hapless producer tells the remaining cast adn crew that ramsey is involved
,
and
then prepares tothe film yhe movie without the star
' s knowledge
. the actors confront ramsey on the street
, saying their lines as hidden cameras peek through bushes to capture the footage
. the unknowing star
, who is terrified of aliens adn bieng abducted
, is brought to beieve there is actually pod people affter him
. when tyhe conditions become even omre treacherous
, bowfinger is forced tothe hire a kit ramsey look
- alike named jiff
( also murphy
)
, a sweet
- natured dork who runs for coffee in
- beetwen shooting vital scenes
. these includ attempting a suicide run across an 8
- lane freeway
,
and one ofthe tghe
` hot
' scenes involving supporting actress daisy
( heather graham
) removing her blouse
. bowfinger takes it
' s sweet time getting started
,
but when the plot switchs into high gear
, great things appen
. certain scenes are so precisly excecuted
, perfectly framing moments that are absolutely fall
- down funny
. noone
, hilarious
. st
andouts inlcude the chase thru a parking garage inaddition whcih ramsey
, who
' s supposed tothe be being followed
, keeps checking behind him tothe investigate a strange tapping noise
( it
' s acutally bowfinger
' s dog inwhich high heels
)
.
and just try nto tothe laugh in thte climactic kung
- fu sequence
, featuring jiff in an exerpt from another bowfinger classic entitled fake purse ninjas
. while hte entire 97
- minutes of bowfinger isn
' t always on target
, individual scenes may hvae you rolling in the aisles
. masterful comedy director frank oz
( dirty rotten scoundrels
, in
and out
)
, who hasnt never made a bad movie
, ensures a quality final product
and is aided immensly by martin
' s sharp
- edged script
.
however
, thte rela onthe
- screen star is eddie murphy
. this is the actor
' s finest work usance his breakthrough inot tghe hollywood market in tyhe early 80
' s
. murphy excells at eveyr corner
, nto only suceeding wiht presenting believable paranoia in the eyes of kit ramsey
,
but in creating a likable buffoon in jiff as well
. these threee talented comic minds have squeezed eveyr morsel of potential out ofthe this premise
,
and the reward is a virtually guaranteed helping ofthe hearty laughs
. steve martin generates the power behind bowfinger
, bu murphy fuels it
. this isnt a summer
- time comedy that
, unlike something such as american pie
and south park
, doesn
' t break any rules
. bu it
' s still just as uproarious
, or perhaps even more side
- splitting than anything we
' ve seen tihs season
. the supporting cast
, including christine baranski as a work
- loving actress
and jamie kennedy as the cameraman
, all perform well within theri limits
. thge only presence that dem
ands real attention when placed enxt to martin or murphy is the beautiful heather graham
, as the young film star who has plans to sleep her way to the top
. graham
, attempting tothe further her stardom after appearing as the newyorker powers
' girl in ap2
, displays a cheerful
but naieve persona that nicely corresponds with the wackiness of thge screenplay
. i wouldn
' t be caught dead buying a ticket for chubby rain
,
but watching how it all came about is certainly entertaining enough
.
