) is responsible forthe the textual changes
. fomr a purely dramatic prespective
, the revision makse perfect sense

, giving that dialogue tothe fanny
. the result is a central charater tath is immediatelly appealing
. as the grown fanny
, australian actress frances o ' connor
( all about adam
) does wonderfully textured work
. at times
