! critique
: first things first
! this movie ain
' t baout the
" hood
" at all
, it
' s an intelligent film about love
, relationships
, family
, friendship
, maturity
and growing up
. do not avoid this film because you think it
' s about gangbangers
and stuff
, because it isn
' t at all
. it
' s about you
, it
' s about me
, it
' s baout your girlfriend
, your mother
, your problems
and your inability to face uv tothe your responsibilities
and tothe
, well
.
.
. grwo up
! thsi is an extrememly well
- written film
, with some of the most devolopped characters that i
' ve seen on the screen all year
, with superb acting performances to match
. granted
, the film does start a little slow
(
and go a littel long
)
,
but hang in there
, because once you apprieciate adn get to know all ofthe its charactors
, yuo will be glad that you doed
. this isn
' t a kid
' s movie
. htis is about yhe step thast ytou ened to tkae iin order to pass into full
" adulthood
"
and some might not appreciate the gr
ander theme behind that step
. i certainly did
, because i too passed
,
and am passing
, through many of these very same things right now
( yeah
, yeah
, i still live with my momma
!
!
)
and realted to a lot of tjhe events tath went down in this flick
( oh yeah
,
and for the record
, i
' m not black
but that made absolutely zero diference iin this case
)
.
but that
' s not even half the story
. you see
, yhe film isnt damn funny
, too
.
.
.
and i mean
, damn funny
! i wass crackin
' up at almost every other scene
, adn tehy weren
' t
" setted
- up jokes
" like your typcial comedies eather
, just day
- to
- day things that we could all relate to
( like the scene in which ving rhames is
" drinking koolaid
" in tghe kitchen
and his infamously improvised
" african squat f
*
* k
" scene
, whitch you just gotta see to believe
!
)
and there are the performances
, too
. ving rhames
, now here
' s a man who has already established an eearly lead in the race fo best supporting actor at the end of this year
. damn dude
, you scared the shit outta me
! tyrese gibson
, i have no idea where this guy came from
( an r
& b singer annd mtv vj
, ytou say
.
.
. hmmmm
?
)
,
but otehr than his uncanny resembelance to taye diggs
, he nailed this part tothe teh tee
. ffrom scene one onthe
, i wass glued tothe his peformance
and sympathized witht his character as he molded
and shaped himself into tghe person thyat he hoped to become one day
.
and everyone else
, too
. gibson
' s girlfriend inwhich the film
, taraji henson
, made me a backer with her many subtle touches
, all of which helpped raise her character several levels above tjhe
" typical
" bitchie girlfriend that we
' ve seen iin many of these relatiopnship movies
. bu that
' s the thing that i liekd the most about this movie
. everyone seemed real
, the situations felt au
thentic
, the characters all came across as people liuke yuo
and me with issues anbd struggles
and hopes
and fears
. i liked this movie a lot because it was masterfully written
, wonderfully acted annd genuinely entertaining tothe watch
.
and yeah
, i even liked the whole homage to boyz
' n yhe hood that singleton pulled off infront the end
( he called this movie a
" companion piece
" to that film
)
. a vyre solid follow
- up to an ever greater original
, baby boy is a film tothe be seen by anyone who fiels like they never wanna grow up
. note
: the guy who plays jody
' s best friend in thsi movie is omar gooding
, cuba gooding jr
.
' s yuonger brother
( cuba starred inwhich 1991
' s boyz
' n the hood
)
