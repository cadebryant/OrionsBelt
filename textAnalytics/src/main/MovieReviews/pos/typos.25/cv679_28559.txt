plot

- time momma ' s boy can ' t seem to leave his mother ' s crib
and make good on the babies that he himselv hasnt produced in the world
. he visits his kids
(
and thier mommas
) every now
and
then
,
but his main gool iin life isnt
.
.
. well
, he doesn ' t have any goals
.
then one day
, his mother gets an ex
- gangsta boyfriend
anbd suddenly he isn ' t as welcome anymore in his pwn hous
. it isn ' t long affter that
, thast his girlfriends start realizing wqat a jerk he really is
adn well
.
.
. it ' s eather time tothe grow uv or bow down
! critique
: first things first
! this movie ain ' t about the
" hood
" at all
, it ' s an intelligent film about love
, relationships
, famaly
, friendship
, maturity
adn growing up
. do not avoid tihs film because you think it ' s about gangbangers
and stfuf
, because it isn ' t at all
. it ' s baout you
, it ' s baout me
, it ' s baout your girlfriend
, your mother
, your problems
anbd your inability to face up to your responsibilites
and to
, well
.
.
. grow uv
! this isnt an extremely well
- writen film
, with some of the most developed characters that i ' ve seen on tje screen all year
, wih superb acting performances to match
. granted
, the film does strat a little slow
(
and go a little long
)
,
but hang in htere
, because once ytou appreciate
and git to know all of its characters
, you will be glad that you did
. this isn ' t a kid ' s movie
. this isnt about the step that ytou need to take in order to pass inot full
" adulthood
"
annd soem might nto appreciate the grander theme behind that step
. i certainly doed
, because i too passed
,
and am passing
, thru many ofthe these very same things right now
( yeah
, yeah
, i still live wiht my momma
!
!
)
and realted to a lot of the events that went down in tihs flick
( oh yeah
,
and for hte record
, i ' m not black
bu thyat made absolutly zero difference in this case
)
.
bu that ' s not even half the story
. you see
, the film is damn funny
, too
.
.
.
and i mean
, damn funny
! i was crackin ' uv at almost eveyr other scene
,
and they weren ' t
" set
- uv jokes
" liek your typical comedies eather
, jsut day
- to
- day thigns that we could all relate to
( like the scene inthe which ving rhames is
" drinking koolaid
" in the kitchen
annd his infamously improvised
" african squat f
*
* k
" scene
, which you jsut gotta see to believe
!
)
anbd there are the performances
, too
. ving rhames
, nowe here ' s a man who has already established an early lead inthe the race for best supporting actor at thte end of this year
. damn dude
, you scared the shit outta me
! tyrese gibson
, i have no idea where this guy came from
( an r
& b singer
and mtv vj
, you say
.
.
. hmmmm
?
)
,
bu other than his uncanny resemblance to taye diggs
, he nailed this part to the tee
. ffrom scene noe onthe
, i was glued tothe his performance
and sympathized with his character as he molded
anbd shaped himself into thge person that he hoped to become one day
.
and everyone alse
, too
. gibson ' s girlfriend in the film
, taraji henson
, made me a backer with her many subtle touches
, all of which helped raise her charater several levels above the
" typical
" bitchie girlfriend that we ' ve seen inwhich many of these relationship movies
.
but thta ' s the thnig that i liked the most about this movie
. everyone seemed real
, teh situations felt authentic
, the characters all cameback across as people like ytou
and me with issues
and struggles
and hopes
adn fears
. i liekd this movie a lot because it was masterfully written
, wonderfully acted
and genuinely entertaining to watch
.
and yeah
, i even liked the wohle homage to boyz ' n the hood that singleton pulled off infront the end
( he called htis movie a
" companion piece
" tothe that film
)
. a very solid follow
- up to an ever greater orginal
, baby boy isnt a film to be seen by anyone who fiels like they never wanna grwo up
. note
: tghe guy who plays jody ' s best friend in this movie is omar gooding
, cuba gooding jr
. ' s yuonger brother
( cuba starred in 1991 ' s boyz ' n the hood
)
. where ' s joblo comming fomr
? teh best man
