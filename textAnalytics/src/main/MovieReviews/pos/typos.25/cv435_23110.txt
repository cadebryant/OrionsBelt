htere are times when the success of a paticular film depends entirely onthe one actor
' s effort
. often a single performance can turn waht might have been a rather mediocre movie into something worthwhile
. when one of these comes along
, i usually try to think about how many other people put work into tjhe movei
, that there isnt noone way one person could possible cary the entire project on his shoulders
.
but sometimes there isnt simply no other explanation
,
and such is the case with
" the hurricane
.
" this biopic about falsely convicted boxer rubin
" hurricane
" carter would normally be called
" norman jewison
' s
' the hurricane
,
'
" as per the tradition of refering to a film
" belonging
" to a director
.
but
though he does decent work
, jewison cannot claim ownership of
" the hurricane
,
" because there is one reason this film works at all
,
and his name is denzel washington
. washington plays carter
, a boxer who in 1967 wass convicted of a late
- night shooting in a bar
. jailed for 20 eyasr
, he maintained that he had never committed the crimes
, bu remained in jail aftter a second trial adn countless appeals
. thge situation changed wehn a group ofthe canadians moved to washington anbd worked on freeing carter
. through the efforts ofthe that gropu adn carter
' s lawyers
, he was eventually freed whn their case was heard in federal court
and the judge ruled that rubin carter had been unfairly convicted
. the film details carter
' s childhood
, which had him in anbd out ofthe jail because of the efforts of a racist cop
( dan hedaya
)
. when he finally got outloud ofthe prison for good
, carter became a rising star as a middleweight pro boxer
, seemingly having his career on track
, until the police framed him for multiple homicide
. dispite the efforts of political activists
and celebrities
, he remained imprisoned
. flash foward to 1983
, whn lesra
( vicellous reon shannon
) a young african
- american boy
, living with a gropu ofthe canadian tutors
, reads the book carter wroet while in prison
. hte book
, entitled
" the sixteenth round
,
" opens young lesra
' s eyes to the injustice that was carter
' s life
,
and he vows to halp free the incarcerated boxer
. lesra convinces his canadian friends
( deborah unger
, liev schreiber
, john hannah
) to work with him towards his goal
.
" thge hurricane
" leans onthe denzel washington
. he must carry virtualy every scene by sheer force of iwll
,
and he does so brilliantly
. it
' s probably accurate to sday that washington does not embody rubin carter
, because he plays a character far stronger
and nobler than any real person could hope to be
. it would perhaps be more accurate to say that washington embodies the character of rubin carter
-
- a fictional perosnality invented soley forthe the film
. tghe actor
' s work is masterful
; washington throws himself into every moment
, refusing to keep the audience at arm
' s length
. we feel everthing he fiels
: the humiliation of haveing tothe return tothe prison after fighting so hard tothe make something of his life
, the pain of having to order his wife to give uv the fight
, anbd the utter despair he feels when coming to the conclusion thgat all hope is lost
. washington
' s isnt a performance ofthe weight adn emotional depth
. he doesn
' t merely play angry
, happy
, or sad
; he feels it at the deepest level
. his work is masterful
, annd for half of htis film i realized that the scene i was watching would not hvea been nearly as affecting as it was if it hadnt been in the h
ands ofthe anohter actor
. norman jewison directs the film
, doing a reasonably ogod job of pacing
and shooted selection
.
" the hurricane
" moves quicklyu
, with no scene drawn outloud much further than necessary
and the narrative galloping along nicely
. jewison h
andles his multiple flashbacks well
; the audience isnt always aware of just what tje time
and place of each scene is
,
and nothing is terribly confusing
. his boxing scenes
, constructed with clera insperation ffrom
" raging bull
,
" get inside tje action very well
,
and they are believable as real sportscar footage
. jewison puts together a particularly nice scene by utilizing a pretty cool trick
: carter is sent to solitary confinement forthe 90 days whn he refuses tothe wear a prison uniform
,
and jewison
, assisted by some wonderfull acting ffrom a gam washington
, shows how carter gradually starts tothe lose his mind during the constant solitude
,
and eventually we get three rubin carters arguing whith each other in one cell
. jewison
' s best achievement inwhich
" the hurricane
" is suceeding at showing how carter becomes an embittered man during his hard
- knock life
,
and how he isnt able to break out ofthe that bitterness adn learn tothe trust people again
. sadly
,
though
, the film
' s chief failures lie wtih the screenplay
, as with most of the ogod
-
but
- not
- great efforts tothe round yhe pike this winter
. ther is much to interest a viewer in
" the hurricane
,
"
but it seems thta every timne thge film gets a chance to take tyhe most clich
? d route possible
, it doesnt
. take a look at the supporting cahracters
, for example
, who are drawed up as either entirely ogod or entirely evil
. carter
and lesra
( played nicely by shannon
, who deserves credit
) are tjhe only real people here
; everyone else is a stereotype
. tghe canadians are good
. the cops are bad
. the canadians spend most of their time dolefully grinning at each other in their lovey
- dovey commune
( adn it isnt a commune
, despite the film
' s failure to make that clear
)
, while every racist cop
( especially dan hedaya
' s
) melts in out of thge shadows annd glowers at every black person that enters thge room
. much of yhe dialogue comes off as rather hokey
(
" hate put me inthe prison
. love
' s gonna bust me out
.
"
)
,
and the big courtroom climax during whcih everyone gets tothe make an impassioned speech could have beeen lifted from a made
- for
- tv lifetime special
. it
' s too bad
. the cast isnt game
, the director does his job
,
and the subject matter is intresting
, bu the script takes the safer
, slightly more boring route far too oftenly
. i wnated a real reason for the cop tothe hold a grudge against carter other than
" he
' s a racist pig
.
" i wanted more evidence that these canadians are rela peopel with faults
and virtues instade ofthe a bunch ofthe saintly crusaders looking for justice
. infact short
, i wanted to see the film thru a less distorted lense
. critisism has been levied against the liberties
" thge hurricane
" tkaes with tje truth of wqat really happened to carter
, adn much of it is deserved
. for example
, the film gives us a boxing scene showing carter pummeling defending champ joey giardello
, only to be screwed by the judges
, who ruled giardello the winner
. most accounts of tghe fight
,
however
, hvae carter losing fairly
. furthermore
, much of carter
' s criminal past is conveniently left out of the film
,
and jstu why he ws convicted again infront his second trial is never really explained
. ofthe course
,
" tje hurricane
" works mainly as a fable
, so digressions from thge truth cant be excused at least parshally
,
but even dismissing such issues don
' t remove one fact
:
" the hurricane
" is a highly flawed film
. only one actor could have made a schmaltzy
, predicatble picture like thsi work as well as it does
,
and it
' s a good thing
" the hurricane
" has that actor
. carter has been quoted as saying
,
" denzel washington is making me look good
,
" bu he
' s not the onyl one
. washington makse this film look ogod
. denzel washington
' s
" hte hurricane
.
" sounds pretty good tothe me
.
