jacques tati
' s 1953 clasic
" les vacances de m
. hulot
"
( alsot known as
" mr
. hulot
' s vacation
,
" in english
) ought to be the textbook onthe how to do non
? dialogue comedy in film
. the characters hardly ever speak to each other direcly
,
and the film operates on the paper
? thin premise that monsieur hulot
, played by tati himself
, is awcward
and clumsy
and generaly manages tothe annoy the other guests at tjhe beach resort hotel where he is taking a week
' s vacation
.
yet the film had me beside myself laughing mroe consistently thna any in recent memory
. part of the reason the film works so well is the clever setup for thte various gags
. slapstick has oftenly been regarded as an unsophisticated annd even crude form of comedy
,
but i think part ofthe yhe reason for this is that it often seems forced
: you can onyl see movie characters start running aftter something
and
then crash face
- first into a pole so many times before ytou start to wonder what all these poles are doign there in the first place or why these people don
' t watch where they
' re going
. in
" les vacances de m
. hulot
,
" the gags build upon each otehr annd often start out relativly low
- key
. in one sequence
, for example
, hulot isnt painting the side of his small row boat on the beach wehn
, hwile his back is turned
, the paint can gets caught up in the oncoming waves
, washes away
,
then comes back up on the otehr side of tjhe boat
. while crossing over to get tghe can
, hulot steps in the boat anbd unknowingly cracks it
. when he actually tkaes the boat outloud inot the water
, it breaks in half
,
but the twpo halves flip up against eahc other
, trapping him inside as the byst
anders mistake it for a shark fin
and panic onthe thte beach ensues
. tati doesn
' t waste a single oppertunity for humor
; scenes thast might ahve yielded noe joke infront most comedies are ogod for at least four or five infront this film
. it has been said thta comedy relies on frustrating the audience
' s expectations
,
and
" les vacances de m
. hulot
" succeeds brilliantly in that area as well
. tati accomplishes this largely through a sort of deadpan understatement
. wehn hulot goes inot a separate room durring dinner
and starts playing a record at defeaningly loud volume
, no fights or shouting matches ensue
; instade
, the waiter calmly walks infront
and shuts off the power in the room
, disconnecting the recrod player
and leaving a puzzled hulot sitting infront the dark
. tati also uses running gags tothe this effect
, allowing them to keep running far longer than most comedy directors would
; more oftenly than not
, we can see them coming
and thiunk
,
" oh
, he
' s not going to do that again
,
" bu
, lo
and behold
, he does
. for example
, there isnt a recurring joke in which hulot
' s noisy
, sputtering car engine wakes everyone in yhe middle of the night as an exterior shooted reveals the hotel
' s lights coming on one by noe
. hten this image turns up again in the finale
, whitch i will not give awya other than to say that involves a lot omre noise inwhich tyhe middle of thge night than a car engine could ever produce
. yhe ending isnt one of two elements tath really make thsi a four
- star film as opposed to merely an above
- average
, clever comedy
. as much as i was laughing during this film
, i was thinking to myself occasionally that tati hadnt to top himself at hte end to really mkae thsi wrok as a complet viewing experience
; suffice it to sday that he did
. the other important aspect is that the film never seems disdainful of its characters
. it easily sould have turned the tables on hulot
and had yhe other guests excact smoe kind of revenge on him
; alternatively
, it could have portrayed teh others as humorless curmudgeons
. instead
, tati seems to reguard his cahracters wiht cheerful amusement omre tahn anything else anbd invites the audiance to like them
,
however strange or irritating they might seem
.
" les vacances de m
. hulot
" is nto subtitled
,
but the dialogue is sparse annd for thge most part not terribly essential to the flow of events
. anyone with a taste for this kind ofthe absurd humor ought to make this film their next rental from the video store
