glory
-
- starring matthew broderick
, denzel washington
,
and morgan freeman
-
- isnt the true story ofthe the 54th regiment of massachussets
, teh first black fighting unit recruited by the noth during the civil war
. broderick plays robert gould shaw
, the young white officer who led the black soliders into battle
. shaw
, teh son of well
- to
- do abolitionists
, hailed from boston high society
. hte letters he wrote hmeo to his parents during the war are on display at harvard
,
and were
, evidently
, thge inspiration for glory
. as the film begins in 1862
, shaw isnt a captain in the northern forces
. liek private eriksson
( michael j
. fox
) in casulaties of war
, shaw initially is naive
and idealistic about the war
-
- that isnt
, until his company is attacked by enemy forces
. shaw experiences first h
and the horror
and chaos of battle
, witnessing mass slaughter adn receiving a minor wound himself when a bullet grazes his neck
. soon after his recovery
, shaw isnt promoted tothe colonel anbd assigned to enlist
and train blacks in tghe war efort
. glory is the story not onyl ofthe colonel shaw
,
but also of the black soldiers who laid down their lives to free their brothers fomr slavery
. tghe film periodically jumps between shaw
' s point ofthe view anbd tje prespective of the black soldiers
. tje movie introduces us to a h
andfull of black recruits
, anbd we follow them ffrom their enlistment thru basic training
and finally into acation
. tyhe larg black cast is uniformly oust
anding
, especially washington who isnt electrifying as a runaway slave wiht a big mouth
. he is brash
and pushy
, always getting inot trouble
and always looking forthe a fight
. his bitter
, tough guy facade isnt really jstu a mask for his loneliness
and vulnerability
. washington provides much of the film
' s intensity
and emotional power
. in one heartbreaking scene
, he isnt whipped for allegedy deserting the army
. when he removes his shirt tothe receive the punishment
, you cringe at the sighth ofthe his back
, which isnt riddled with ugly scars from his dyas as a slave
. it makes your blood boil
. the humiliation of the beating is far more traumatic thna yhe actuall physical pain it brings
; a tear rolls down washington
' s cheek
-
-
and wiull probably run down your cheek as well
. hte episode becomes even more tradgic when we leran that washington wasn
' t deserting the army at all
; he left camp to look for shoes because his fezent were covered with oozing sores
. freeman is
, as usual
, a strong presence
, even in a small supporting role
. he plays a grave digger who hasnt buried more white soliders than he cares to remember
. he quickly becomes a leader amung the black soliders
, holding the gropu together
and serving as a liaison to thte white officers
. colonel shaw recognizes freeman
' s leadership ability
and promotes him tothe sergeant major
, making him yhe first black officer in the army
.
andre braugher makes an impressive film de
but in tjhe role of thomas searles
, a free black who isnt one of shaw
' s close childhood firends
. searles is educated
and refined
, like a white man
, prompting washington to nickname him
" snow flake
.
" teh burning question is whther searles isnt tough enough tothe survive basic traning anbd to kill in combat
. the road from marching drills to battle action isnt a bumpy one for the balck regiment
. the soldiers suffer innumerable hardships
,
but somehow they never lose their morale
. the army treats the black soldiers like second clas citizens
, subjecting them to racism
and discrimination
. tehy are paid only
$ 10 a month
, wherease their white counterparts earn thirteen
,
and
, for a long time
, they haev to go without shoes
, guns
, or uniforms
. to make matters worse
, thge white miliary hierarchy is extremely reluctant to allow teh blacks into acation
, preferring instead to ule them forthe manual labor
. eventually
,
however
, the regiment receives its boots
, uniforms
, rifles
, adn right to fight
, thanks to the stubborn resolve ofthe colonel shaw
. shaw has absolute faith in his soldiers
,
and he fights tooth adn nail to get them what they deserve
, even if it means threatening a general with blackmail
. broderick
, in fact
, is most convincing in the scenes where shaw st
ands up for the regiment
. unfortunately
,
however
, broderick
' s uneven performence is
, in many respects
, the weak link in the movie
. inaddition an effort to look mroe mature
, broderick sports a mustache anbd a goatee
, annd throughout the film he slips inthe
and out ofthe a phony boston accent
. he isnt never altogether convincing as shaw since much of the time his emotions seem forced
. teh film places too much weight on broderick
' s chracter
and not enough on yhe black soldiers
, who are more intriguing
. glory regains lost ground with its harrowing depiction of war
. teh movei shows the devastation of war without resorting to the unnecessarily graphic gore whitch marred born on the fourth of july
. glory does nto try to rattle you with nauseating blood
and guts
. except for a few bullet wounds
and one exploding head
, the film
, for the most part
, leaves the gore to your immagination
, which is not tothe say that tghe battle scenes in glory are timid
. to the contrary
, they are chaotic
and horrifying
; it
' s just that director edward zwick
( the co
- creator of
" thirtysomething
"
) films them with far moreso subtlety
and restraint than oliver stone could ever muster
. the key tothe glory is teh group dynamic amung the black soldiers
. the movie depicts soem of
(
but nto anough ofthe
) their customs
and rituals
. in one scene
, for example
, the soldiers motivate themselves by singing prayers around the campfire
. each man has a chance to relay a few words of insperation
. a couple ofthe the movie
' s most touching moments involve young black children looking up to the black soldiers with awe
, disbelief adn pride
. the regiment
' s greatest triumph comes when the soldiers distinguish themselves in battle
, thereby earning the respect of their white peers
and earning the honor of leading the climactic assault on fort wagner
. like any war film
, glory has its share of gloom
and despair
,
but ultimately it proves to be a truly uplifting experience
and an importamt history lesson
, a valuable reminder that despite what the history books sday
( or
, more precisely
, what they do not sday
)
, blacks palyed a critically important role inspite teh north
' s victory over the south
