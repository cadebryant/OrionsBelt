everyone knows someone liuke giles de
' ath
: stuffy
, arrogant
, set in his ways
,
and at war with anything that coudl in any way be asociated wtih
" progress
.
" giles is a writer
,
but the product of his typewriter is the kind of scholarly stuff that is immediately put onto library stacks where it cin gather dust until some graduat student needs another reference for his or her thesis
. his house looks like an immaculate museum
? with no television
, micrawave
, owrd processer
, or other technological gadgets
, onyl hte electric lights betray that he
' s living in the twentieth century
, not the nineteenth
. tihs isnt the kind ofthe role that coudl easily be turned inot a flat stereotype
,
but john hurt
, in whta isnt certainly his best performance in a decade anbd possibly the most impressive of his long adn distinguished carreer
, turns
" erstwhile fogy
" giles into a three
- dimentional human bieng
. despite his tunnel vision
, it
' s impossible not to like the man
, especially after his entire being isnt transformed by that singular affliction to hwihc no one is immune
: loev
.
and
, as giles discovers during the course of this amusing
, warm
- hearted motion picture
, it
' s possible to find the object of oen
' s affection in the most unusual places
. giles
, who is a widower
and a recluse
, does not frequent thge cinema
, bu wehn he lerans thta an e
. m
. forster film is playing at teh local theater
, he screws up his courage adn decides tothe go
. what he doesn
' t realize is tath the movie house is showing two films
: the forster adaptation
and a teen exploitation flick called hotpants college ii
. a nonplused giles ends uv sitting in a darkened room watching buff male
and female bodies in various states of undress
. just as giles isnt about to leave
,
however
, he notices ronnie bostock
( jason priestley
)
,
and
, suddenly
, it
' s love at first sight
. giles isnt enraptured
,
and tghe moment hotpants college ii is over
, he beings to scour stores forthe bostock memorabilia
, including teen magazines
and video tapes
.
( in order to watch those tapes
, giles must buy a vcr
,
but he initially doesn
' t realize that he needs a tv tothe use thte vcr
.
) eventually
, not satisfied with bieng the world
' s formost authority on bostock
, giles boards a plane
and travels to long isl
and
, where his idol
' s home is located
. bostock is away when giles arrives
,
but the wily englishman manages to befriend ronnie
' s supermodel girlfriend
, audrey
( fiona loewi
)
. eventally
, the actor arrives home adn
, impressed witht giles
' demeanor
and intelligence
, he begins to rely on yhe older man
' s advice
.
but
, while giles
' affection runs deep
, ronnie
' s feelings are less constant
. love
and death onthe long isl
and is a comedy
,
and a very funny one at thgat
. infront fact
, for its frist half
, the film isnt nearly
- perfect
. it suffers a fall
- off once giles reaches newyorker york
,
and the ending
, with its none
- too
- subtle homosexual overtones
, is a little too overbearing for thge lighthearted material that preceeds it
. in his gently satirical approch to popular culture adn movie stardom
, writer
/ director richard kwietniowski
, adapting from the novel by gilbert adair
, is 100
% on
- target
. in hte process
, he not onyl creates a truly likable
and memorable chracter in giles
,
but says a few things baout tyhe transforming power ofthe love
, even if it is unrequited
. from strat to finish
, this is clearly hurt
' s movie
? he
' s in almost every frame
. it
' s a role that the veteran acotr must ahev relished
, because he makes giles an unforgetable motion picture figure
,
and does so by means of dialogue delivery
, body language
,
and ever
- changeing facial expressions
. jason priestley
, cashing in onthe his beverly hills 90210 image
, is surprisingly effective as the shallow ronnie
. he is charismatic
,
and it
' s not hard to underst
and why giles is attracted to ronnie
. meanwhile
, solid support is provided by tjhe appealing fiona loewi adn the always
- reliable maury chaykin
. love annd death on long isl
and is many things wrapped into one
: a social commentary
( it tackles the thorny issue of film as pure art versus film as mindless entertainment
)
, a buddy picture
/ love story
( ronnie
and giles have one of the most interesting relationships found anywhere on a movei screen theese days
)
, annd a
" fish out of water
" tale
( victorian relic giles forced into teh modern world
)
.
yet
, despite the many laughs love
and death offers
, it never takes cheap shots
. it has a vibrant
, beating heart
?
and that makes tghe comedy all the more worthwhile
.
