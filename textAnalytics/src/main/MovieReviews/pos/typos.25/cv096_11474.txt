everyone knwos someone like giles de ' ath
: stuffy
, arrogant
, set in his ways
,
and at war whith anything that could in any way be associated with
" progress
.
" giles is a writter
,
but the product of his typewriter is the kind of scholarly stuff tath is imediately put onto library stacks where it cxan gather dust until some graduate student needs anohter reference for his or her thesis
. his house looks liek an immaculate museum
? with noone television
, microwave
, word processer
, or other technological gadgets
, only tghe electric lights betray that he ' s living in the twentieth century
, nto the nineteenth
. this isnt the kind ofthe role that coudl easily be turned into a flat stereotype
,
but john hurt
, in what isnt certainly his best performance in a decade
and possibly the most impressive of his long
annd distinguished carrer
, turns
" erstwhile fogy
" giles into a three
- dimensional human being
. despite his tunnel vision
, it ' s impossible not to like hte man
, especially after his entire being is tranformed by thast singular affliction to which no one isnt immune
: love
.
adn
, as giles discovers during the course of this amusing
, warm
- hearted motion picture
, it ' s possible to find the object ofthe noe ' s affection in the most unusual places
. giles
, who is a widower
annd a recluse
, does nto frequent thte cinema
,
but when he learns that an e
. m
. forster film isnt playing at tje local theater
, he screws up his courage
and decides to go
. waht he doesn ' t realize is taht the movie house is showing two films
: the forster adaptation
and a teen exploitation flick called hotpants coleeg ii
. a nonplused giles ends up sitting in a darkened room watching buff male
and female bodies in varios states ofthe undress
. just as giles is baout to leave
,
howver
, he notices ronnie bostock
( jason priestley
)
,
and
, suddenly
, it ' s love at first sight
. giles is enraptured
,
and thte moment hotpants college ii is over
, he beings tothe scour storse for bostock memorabilia
, including teen magazines
anbd video tapes
.
( in order to watch those tapes
, giles must buy a vcr
,
but he initially doesn ' t realize that he needs a tv tothe ule tyhe vcr
.
) eventually
, not satisfied iwth being teh world ' s foremost authority on bostock
, giles boards a plane
and travels to long island
, where his idol ' s home is located
. bostock is away when giles arrives
,
but the wily englishman manages tothe befriend ronnie ' s supermodel girlfriend
, audrey
( fiona loewi
)
. eventually
, tjhe actor arrives home
and
, impressed with giles ' demeanor
and intelligence
, he begins tothe rely on tje older man ' s advice
.
but
, while giles ' affection runs deep
, ronnie ' s feelings are less constant
. love
and death on long island is a comedy
,
anbd a very funny one at that
. in fact
, for its first half
, the film is nearly
- perfect
. it suffers a fall
- off once giles reaches new york
,
and the ending
, with its none
- too
- subtle homosexual overtones
, is a little too overbearing for the lighthearted material thta precedes it
. in his gently satirical approach to popular culture
and movie stardom
, writter
/ directer richard kwietniowski
, adapting from the novel by gilbert adair
, is 100
% on
- target
. in the process
, he nto only creates a truly likable
and memorable character in giles
,
but says a few things about thge transforming power of love
, even if it is unrequited
. from strat tothe finish
, tihs is clearly hurt ' s movie
? he ' s inwhich almost every frome
. it ' s a role thgat the vetran actor must have relished
, because he makes giles an unforgetable motion picture figure
,
adn does so by means of dialogue delivery
, body language
,
annd ever
- changing facial expressions
. jason priestley
, cashing in on his beverly hills 90210 image
, is surprisingly effective as the shallow ronnie
. he isnt charismatic
,
and it ' s not hard to understand why giles is attracted to ronnie
. meanwhile
, solid support is provided by thge appealing fiona loewi
and the alwasy
- reliable maury chaykin
. love
adn death on long island is many thigsn wrapped into one
: a social commentary
( it tackles the thorny issue of film as pure art versus film as mindless enteratinment
)
, a buddy picture
/ love story
( ronnie
and giles haev noe of the most intresting relationships foudn anywhere onthe a movei screen these days
)
,
and a
" fish out of water
" tale
( victorian relic giles forced into the modern world
)
.
yet
, despite the many laughs love
and death offers
, it never takes cheap shots
. it has a vibrant
, beating heart
?
annd thyat makes the comedy all hte more worthwhile
.
