" yhe film isnt directed by jerry zucker
, who knows something baout comedy
. along witht his brother
, david
,
and friend jim abrahams
, he was responsible for such hits as airplane
!
and ruthless people
. a throwaway subplot
, which isnt good for some laughs
, features cleese
and his buddies
, betting on a sories of outl
andish situations
, including one dealing with a hooker annd pepto
- bismol
. this is a fun little feature
. the only letdown comes at tje finale

and sweet
, almost negating what came before it
. rat race is a summer sleeper
, bu it will keep you awake
, as will the laughter of those watching around you
