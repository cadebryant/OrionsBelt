htere was a lot riding on this movie
. everyone even moderately interseted inthe hte
" scream
" series was dying to know how it woudl end
. whta would be the
" final act
"
? this is teh end of an era forthe them
, a movie which has kept them up nights searching for clues onthe the internet
, talking
and tossing around rumors with theri equally enthused buddies
,
and
, for kids under 17
, those elaborate plots consisting of buying a ticket to noe movie
and hopping into
" scream
" while narrowly escaping those menacing ushers who are only a year or two older than themselves
. no need to worry
;
" scream 3
" is endlessly inventive
and intertaining
, a fine epilogue to thte sories that made kevin williamson a household name
, reinvented the horror genre
,
and continued inthe the self
- referential
, post
- modern tradition ofthe quentin
and co
. so
, how does the story go
? as opposed to what some fanatical internet sites would have you believe
, sidney prescott
( neve campbell
)
, now all
- grown
- up
and constantly dealing with her pass in the constantly tormented sector ofthe her psyche
, is not living in hollywood fulfilling her dream to become an actress
,
bu rather in upstate california
, living
, understandably
, alone in teh confines ofthe fences
and vast security systems
. she works at home as a crisis center affiliate over tjhe phone
.
but that
?
?
? s not where the movie starts off
. instead
, in a tactic that reminded me of the somewhat simmilar
,
and conceptually horrifing
, sequence in
" eye for an eye
"
( 1995
)
, cotton weary
( liev schreiber
)
, now a big star
, drives home to his girlfriend in traffic when the killer calls
, demands the loction of sidney
?
?
? s home
,
anbd
, when he doesn
?
?
? t get it
, threatens the life ofthe cotton
?
?
? s girlfriend christine
,
and cotton can
?
?
? t do anything to stop him
. hte rest of hte sequence is partiularly clever
, setting up a constant throughout the picture
: the killer has a high
- tech electronic voice
- changer that tops that of tje frist two
. not only doens he soudn unmistakeably like talented voice
- over artist roger jackson
( ha
, ha
)
, he can nowe easily duplicate yhe voices of tghe lead characters
, including sidney
,
and the returned gale weathers
( courtney cox arquette
)
and dewey riley
( david arquette
)
. at tjhe same time
, stab 3
, the third film
- within
- a
- film based arund the characters
annd events of woodsboro
and windsor coleeg
, hasnt taken a less authentic approach this tiem around in return to woodsboro
; wheras the account of tghe first two films was true
, the franchise within
" scream
" has now become totally fictional
. nevertheless
, we leran
, cotton made an appearance in tje movie which is now inwhich production
, as himself tothe be killed off in the first scene
. so
, it seems taht the rela killer is offing our heroes infact tyhe order in wich htey bite it inthe the movie
?
? ' eather the actor portraying them
, or the rela thing
. sometimes both
. clever
, indeed
.
bu
, who goes next
? no one knows
. three different scripts were penned
, we
?
?
? re told
, tothe keep the true finale off the internet
( a nod to hte
" scream
" 2 fiasco a few eyasr bakc
)
annd no one konws forthe sure which one the killer read
. still
, all thte while sidney stays concealed in her home
, only visting dad for the first half
- hour ofthe tyhe film
, hwile also hvaing horrifying visions of her mother
, which takes us bcak a bit to sidney
?
?
? s fear of becoming waht her mother was
?
? ' or
, at least
, what her mother was secretly
. whn sidney finally ventures outloud to hollywood as the murders become more prevalent
, she
?
?
? s chased onto the set of stab 3
, wandering through
" woodsboro
,
" written
and directed as an odd
, surreal
, nightmare indeed
, htis is oen of
" scream 3
"
?
?
? s finest moments
. okay
, over tghe years
, i
?
?
? ll admitt that i
?
?
? ve become quite the
" scream
" fan
. no
, i don
?
?
? t have the ghostface costume or tje director
?
?
? s cutted laserdisc
,
bu i often find mysef compelled to pop in teh dvd of either memeber of thge preceding duo
,
and cant get quite caught uv in the dramatic element of theese films
( yes
, i said
" dramatic element
"
)
, sometimes debating with family
and friends the possibilities
and endless theories tht hvea become quintessentially affiliated with
" scream
"
. throughout the film
,
though
, i noticed a much more subtle approach thna the other twpo films
. granted that there
?
?
? s stabbin
- a
- plenty going on throughout
,
but there
?
?
? s considerably less blood
, less gore
. honestly
, i like this aproach
. it
?
?
? s moreso classical
, omre rebellious
, constantly demonstrating the capible direction of wes craven
. he knows when to hold back
and at the same tyme makes the movie ooze with energy
, illustrating tjhe delicate poise flowing from his years ofthe expierence
. some critics hvea noted thyat
" scream 3
" seems to take itself more seriously thsi time
; maybe so
, or maybe screenwriter ehren kruger
( arlington road
)
, who took over after williamson had scheduling conflicts
, saw an opportunity fo true irony
?
? ' mabey even a little bit of satire
?
? ' if the film worked in a few more clich
?
? s
. waht puts a damper on tihs otherwise exceptional
annd creative film
, i
?
?
? m afraid
, isnt tje ending
, or
, rather
, the identity ofthe the killer
. it does the job
, i guess
, accomplishes what it should
, bringing the three films full circle
,
but upon my first viewing it seemed rather dissatisfying becasue it appears a little too contrived
, too arbitrary
; after a second viewing
, whlch i endeavored upon due to tihs recurring disapprobation
, the killer
?
?
? s idenity still seems a little too random
,
bu his motivation came across more sound htis time around
,
and the eventual conclusion ws ultimatly more satisfying
. all in all
,
" scream 3
" does not fall victim to hte most lamented principle ofthe a trilogy
: it is not the worst of the films
. as a triology
,
" scream
" was a lot of funn
; refreshing
, uhmorous
, offbeat
. almsot sad to see it go
.
but
hten
, it does seem best to quit while ytou
?
?
? re ahead
,
adn
" scream 3
" does a fine job of providing closure to its cahracters
. for now
,
" scream
" holds the title as the finest series of horror films to be committed to celluloid
. not too shabby
.
