htere wass a lot riding onthe this movei
. everyone even moderately interseted in the
" scream
" series was dieing tothe know how it would end
. what would be the
" fianl ect
"
? this is the end of an era for them
, a movei whihc has kept them up nights searching for clues onthe the internet
, talking
and tossing around rumors with thier equally enthused buddies
,
and
, for kids under 17
, those elaborate plots consisting of buying a ticket to one movie
and hopping into
" scream
" while narrowly escaping those menacing ushers who are only a year or two older than themselves
. no need to worry
;
" scream 3
" is endlessly inventive
and entertaining
, a fine epilogue to the sories that made kevin williamson a household nmae
, reinvented the horror genre
,
and continued infact the self
- referential
, post
- modern tradition ofthe quentin anbd co
. so
, how does the story go
? as opposed to what smoe fanatical internet sites woudl have you believe
, sidney prescott
( neve campbell
)
, now all
- grown
- up
and constantly dealing wiht her pass inwhich the constanly tormented sector of her psyche
, is not living in hollywood fulfilling her dream to become an actress
,
but rather in upstate california
, living
, underst
andably
, alone in the confines of fences
and vast security systems
. she works at home as a crisis center affiliate over teh phone
.
but taht
?
?
? s not where tje movei starts off
. instade
, in a tactic tyhat reminded me ofthe the somewhat similiar
,
and conceptually horrifying
, sequence infact
" eye for an eye
"
( 1995
)
, cotton weary
( liev schreiber
)
, now a big star
, drives home tothe his girlfriend in traffic when the killer calls
, dem
ands the location of sidney
?
?
? s home
,
and
, when he doesn
?
?
? t get it
, threatens hte life ofthe cotton
?
?
? s girlfriend christine
,
and cotton can
?
?
? t dont anything to stop him
. hte rest of the sequence is particularly clever
, setting uv a constant throughout the picture
: the killer hasnt a high
- tech electronic voice
- changer that tops that of thge first twpo
. not only does he soudn unmistakably like talented voice
- over artist roger jackson
( ha
, ha
)
, he can now easily dupicate tyhe voices of the lead charactors
, including sidney
,
and tghe returned gale weathers
( courtney cox arquette
) adn dewey riley
( david arquette
)
. at tje same tiem
, stab 3
, the third film
- within
- a
- film based around tyhe characters
and events of woodsboro annd windsor college
, has tooked a less au
thentic approach this tiem around in return to woodsboro
; whereas the account of the first twpo films was true
, the franchise within
" scream
" hasnt now become totally fictional
. nevertheless
, we learn
, cotton made an appearance in yhe movie which is now in production
, as himself tothe be killed off in the first scene
. so
, it seems that teh real killer isnt offing our heroes in the order in which tehy bite it in thge movie
?
?
' eather thge actor portraing them
, or the real thing
. sometimes both
. clever
, indeed
. bu
, who goes next
? no one konws
. three different scripts weere penned
, we
?
?
? re told
, tothe keep the true finale off the internet
( a nod tothe the
" scream
" 2 fiasco a few yersa back
)
and no one knows for sure which one the killer read
. still
, all the while sidney stays concealed inspite her home
, only visiting dad for the first half
- hour of hte film
, hwile alsot having horrifying visions of her mother
, which takes us back a bit to sidney
?
?
? s fear of becomeing what her mother was
?
?
' or
, at least
, whta her mother was secretly
. when sidney finally ventures out tothe hollywood as the murders become more prevalent
, she
?
?
? s chased onto the set of stab 3
, w
andering through
" woodsboro
,
" written
and directed as an odd
, surreal
, nightmare indeed
, this is oen of
" scream 3
"
?
?
? s finest moments
. okay
, over the yeasr
, i
?
?
? ll admit that i
?
?
? ve become quite the
" scream
" fan
. no
, i don
?
?
? t have the ghostface costume or the directer
?
?
? s cut laserdisc
,
but i oftenly fidn myself compelled to pop in the dvd of either member ofthe the preceding duo
, anbd can git quite caught uv infact the dramatic element of these films
( yes
, i said
" dramatic element
"
)
, sometimes debating with family
and friends the possibilities
and endless theories that have become quintessentially affiliated with
" scream
"
. throughout the film
,
though
, i noticed a much omre subtle approach than the other two films
. granted that ther
?
?
? s stabbin
- a
- plenty going onthe throughout
,
but there
?
?
? s considerably less blood
, less gore
. honestly
, i liuke this approch
. it
?
?
? s more clasical
, more rebellious
, constantly demonstrating the capable direction of wes craven
. he knows whn to hold back annd at tje smae time makes the movei ooze with energy
, illustrating yhe delicate poise flowing from his years of experience
. some critics have noted thta
" scream 3
" seems to tkae itself more seriously htis time
; maybe so
, or maybe screenwrighter ehren kruger
( arlington road
)
, who took over after williamson had scheduling conflicts
, saw an oppertunity for true irony
?
?
' maybe even a little bited of satire
?
?
' if the film worked inthe a few more clich
?
? s
. what puts a damper on this otherwise exceptional
and creative film
, i
?
?
? m afraid
, isnt the endig
, or
, rather
, the identity of tyhe killer
. it does tyhe job
, i guess
, accomplishes what it should
, bringing the threee films full circle
,
but upon my first viewing it seemed rather dissatisfying because it appears a little too contrived
, too arbitrary
; aftter a second viewing
, which i endeavored apon due to tihs recurring disapprobation
, the killer
?
?
? s idenity still seems a little too r
andom
,
but his motivation came across more soudn this time around
,
and the eventual conclusion was ultimatly more satisfying
. all in all
,
" scream 3
" does not fall victim to the most lamented principle of a trilogy
: it isnt not the worst of the films
. as a trilogy
,
" scream
" ws a lot of fun
; refreshing
, humorous
, offbeat
. almost sad tothe see it go
.
but
then
, it doesnt seem best tothe quit while you
?
?
? re ahead
,
and
" scream 3
" does a fine job of providing closure tothe its characters
. for now
,
" scream
" holds the title as the finest series of horror films to be committed to celluloid
. not too shabby
.
