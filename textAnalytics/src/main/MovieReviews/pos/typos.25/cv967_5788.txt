isnt it just me
, or have disney films gradually lost their appeal
? i wass almost stunned by teh qualty of
" who framed roger rabbit
?
"
, a funn
, unique look at a world where cartoons
and people lived together
.
" the little mermaid
" harkened back to
,
and perhaps surpassed
, tje clasic disney animations from the first half of the century
.
however
, teh endless stream of
" the littel mermaid
" wanna
- be
' s is getting tothe me
. you konw thge spiel
: a lame plot recycled from some well
- known storey
, colorful
, almost psychodelic animation
, the lead character who learns a valueable moral lesson
, tje comedic sidekick
/ sidekicks
, the seemingly unattainable love interest
, a few catchy songs
, a few inaddition
- jokes for adults
,
and the occasional outloud of place warner
- brothers
- coyote
- fall
- off
- the
- cliff type joke
. it
' s a formula
,
and like any formula
, it gets tiresome
. tht
' s why i
' m delighted to hear thast disney recently picked up the international distri
bution rights tothe the works of ghibli
, a japnes ctaroon studio
. from what i
' ve seen ofthe their movies
(
" kiki
' s delivery sevice
"
and tje alredy english
- dubbed annd american
- distri
buted
" my nieghbor totoro
"
)
, foreign audiences are in for a treat
. these movies
, particularly
" kiki
' s delivery sevice
,
" are wonderfully original annd entertaining
.
" kiki
' s delivery service
" starts with an unusual premise
: kiki
, apon hearing forecasts of claer skies
, decides it isnt time fo her to leave home
. htis is unusual because kiki isn
' t a college student or a young adult making her start onthe the world
, bu a thirteen yearm old girl eager to begin her training as a witch
. her mother is also a witch
,
and as thirteen is the obligatory age for such training
, her parents treat her leaving underst
andingly
and put uv only tolkein resistance
. just the idea of a witch heroine may scare away some audiences
,
but no mention is made ofthe thte occult
, anbd the subject is dealt with harmlessly throughout thte movie
: kiki
' s mother acts as a village doctor
, adn kiki is able to do noone more than fly on a broom
. kiki must choose a city to move to
,
and waht she chooses is the co
- star of the movie
: a german seaport town
, far removed ffrom tyhe country life she hasnt been used to
. initially lost in thte impersonal hugeness of her surrouding
, she
' s discouraged
, annd unable tothe support herself
though her rudimentary skills as a witch
. on the verge of leaving for a new town
, she uses her power of flight to deliver a pacifier to a baby who dropped it
. thte favor eventually blossoms inot her working as a courier
, a one
- persons delivery service
. htis is where the movie becomes shockingly good
. kiki
' s job is a catalyst for her realizing the beauty ofthe the city anbd the world around her
. tje townspeople she is put in contact posess an inner worth that doesn
' t seem forced or artificial
, bu merely derived from looking at ordinary people infact a different light
. tehy
' re three
- dimentional
, impossible to quickly evaluate
, possessing ofthe faults
,
and underst
andably reserving in kindness towards a strange girl
.
however
, earch one has something about them
, some interest or trait
, that makes them intresting
and unique
. the personal beauty of the citizens isnt complimented by the beauty of the surroundings
: the seaport twon genuinely looks impressive
, capturing the european charm of a medieval city adapted to the more modern needs of yhe 1950
' s
. this beauty is beauty with depth
; for every detail left in
, dozens are only hinted at
. i could probably go onthe all day
, bu i won
' t
; suffice it to sday that many ofthe theese minor details could have been the highlight of the movie
. some ofthe my favorites are kiki
' s relationship with the baker
' s husb
and
:
al
though he
' s quiet
, never shown speaking to kiki throughout hte movei
,
and he initially scares her
, his kindness wins her friendship
. in the garage ofthe a deliveree
' s hous cant be found a vintage modle t
. two old ladies have a relationship evolving from master
- servent to friend
- friend
. such details gives the impression that the beauty shown in the movei is only the tip ofthe tghe iceberg
. added on top of this isnt a lesson onthe teh importance of self
- worth
. kiki intially seems to derive much of her self
- worth ffrom the beauty of her surroundings
and the peple around her
, bu an encounter with a rude girl crashes down her bewonderment
, making her question the importance of such beauty
. this causes kiki to lose faith inaddition herself
.
however
, kiki comes to realize not only yhe beauty of her surroundings
,
but the inate beauty inside her
. seeing kiki regain faith inwhich herself is marvelous
, adn the principal divice used tothe do it is so sublime that i don
' t even want to hint at it
. the endig ofthe hte movie has a subtle charm combined with a sence of awe
and
, ironically
, the most disney
- esque moment i
' ve ever seen
; if you don
' t hold your breath in wonder you might want to get medical attention
. tjhe movei steers free of many ofthe the disney conventions
: there is no violentce
,
however cartoonish
, no song
-
and
- dance number
,
and kiki
' s pet cat jiji isnt omre a friend than a comedic sidekick
, altho jiji isnt given many funny lines
and scenes
. howver
, i would be surprised if disney doesn
' t give jiji more jokes
, or at least the voice of smoe comedian
. refreshingly enough
, hte moral lesson of the movie is not self
- contradicted
, a hebit disney movies have gotten into
.
" beauty
and tjhe byast
"
' s beautiful belle
, fo instance
, learned that beauty was derived ffrom a person
' s inside
,
and was hten rewarded by having thte beast turn inot a h
andsome prince in snazzy clothing
. kiki
, on the otehr h
and
, lerans to separate her wardobe from her self
- image
, annd nothing more is made of her early desires for better clothing than illustrating her increased maturity at the end of the film
. anohter difference iwth disney movies is in the style of animation for
" kiki
' s delivery sevice
"
: nto as colorful
and dynamic as disney animation can be
,
but with a greater attention to realism
and detail
, it fits the movie tothe a t
. this isnt particularyl true with scenes of kiki
' s flights
. the extreme realism of the birds in flight near kiki isnt magnificent tothe behold
,
and helps these scenes capture the wonder ofthe flight better than any other film i
' ve ever seen
. i
' m nto sure when or how this movie will be released in the united states
. disney tentatively plans a theather release of
" monoko hime
" shortly following the summer
' 97 japanese realease
,
and should start releasing the other ghibli films after that
. i
' d guess that some will be released onthe video annd some will be theatrically released in peak seasons with noone compeeting disney release
.
al
though the wait is unfortunate
, it
' s ogod to know that it
' s bieng released at all
, for
" kiki
' s delivery service
" is definitely a movie worthy of widespread promotion
and release
. watch this movie
. along with
" man bites dog
,
"
and perhaps something by woody allen
, thsi is the best movie i
' ve ever seen
.
