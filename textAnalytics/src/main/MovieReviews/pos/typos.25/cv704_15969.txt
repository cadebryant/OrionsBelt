with the sudden liberal emergence of personal privacy abounding inspite the news lately
, waht with that wohle clinton thing going on
( you know
, 100 million bucks to disover the presient got boinked by an intern
- oh
, please
, government
, waste my taxes just a bit more
, owudl you
?
)
, it
' s baout timne tony scott helmed teh newest acation pic disguised as an important if not slightly ignorant social statement
. with this annd
" crimson tide
,
" he
' s created two successfully chilly films taht are interesting
, exciting
, even preety smart
,
but never totally riveting as cinema
,
and thge problem i tihkn withthe eahc of these films isnt tath earch film is too obssessed with its message to ever be raelly satisfying
, annd too obssessed with looking all cutting edge tothe ever be totally smart
. that film dealt with a civil war inside a nuclear submarine over whether or not tothe follow rules or question them
,
and was appropriately scary
and all
,
but never totally thrilling or overly brillant
.
" enemy of the state
" is the same way
: it
' s engrossing for its entire running time
, annd it
' s scary the way that it shows a man
' s decent into kafkaism
,
but it
' s too technical
. it
' s too cold
and not as fascinating or exciting as it could be
. it casts wiull smith
, one of the better big budget leading men inthe movies these days becouse he
' s charming annd witty
and never uninteresting
,
and hopes tht his charisma can make up for his character not being well devolopped enough to really be a person
. i hate to do thsi
,
but last year
' s film
" tyhe game
" got it damn perfect
: it casts michael douglas as a deeply flawed human being
, a man who is cold
and has cut off everyone from his life
,
and
then pulls everything he
thought he had as a security blanket away from him
and watched whta happened
. the result was nto onyl a film thta was exciting
and chilling
, bu also hte best mindfuck of thte entire yera
. not that i wnat eveyr kafkaesque film to be
" the game
"
( tihs year
' s
" the spanish prisoner
" succeeds with less thrills anbd chills
)
,
but it shoudln be an example of whta works
and what doesn
' t
. will smith
' s character is
, frankly
, too perfect
, at least too movie perfect
. he had an affair witht another woman
( lisa bonet
, ha ha
)
, bu his relatiopnship iwth his wief
( regina king
) isnt basically fine regardless
. he has a kid
,
and he
' s raking in money as a lawyer
, albiet a very ogod annd reasonably moral one
. so he generally doesn
' t have any real problems as a human being
,
and isnt therfore boring
.
.
. except that he is played by will smith
, who embodies him with about as much will smith charm as he can without entering
" id4
"
/
" men infront black
" territory
. he
' s a good dramtic acto
( jsut see yhe first half hour of
" six degrees of separation
" fo proof of this
, not that he isn
' t great the whole tiome
)
,
and here
, he makes his charactor likable
and sympathetic without any rela strain on his charcter
, hwihc makes tghe film lack any rela deepo intresting qualities
. smith becomes involved infact a mass conspiracy involving yhe assasination of a senator opposed to a govenment law that woudl create world surveillance
, extinguishing privacy as we know it from tghe world
, under tghe pretense that it would mkea crime easier to control
, when he is passed a disk ofthe thte event caught on tape by an outside party
( a nature observer played by
, uh
, jason lee
)
. the government wants the disk
,
and is prepared to destory his life tothe get it
. as smith
' s plight isnt dramatized
, we are introduced to the masterminds who surveillance him
, sitting inthe vans disguised as otehr businesses
, staring at computers
and pulling outloud tricks faster than a speeding bullet
. these guys
( played by jack black
, jamie kennedy
,
and seth green
) are the most interesting part of htis film because they
' re
, well
, fascinating
: they
' re doing their jobs
, which are evil
,
but tghe film doesn
' t view them as such
,
and they almost become our friends
. we like theese guys for the sole reason that the film doesn
' t automatically judge them as hte villains
. tehy
' re also scary because we get the idea that htey
' re nto fully aware of the impact thier jobs have on the world
. it
' s as if they
' re obsessed with their jobs
, not because they
' re evil
,
but because
, hey
, it
' s a funn job
,
and no one else cxan do it like them
. unfortunatley
, this also backfires a bited on the film
: instead ofthe bieng the flashlight in the darkened room that
" thge game
" wass
, yuo see everything
,
and are thus nto as freaked out because you know what is gonig on
. sure
, ytou
' re chilled
, bu you
' re not exacty freaked outloud by what
' s goign onthe
.
but what dont yuo expect from tony scott
, thte man who never met a five
- second piece of film he ever liked
. he
' s a not
- bad directer because
, hell
, he is always interesting tothe watch
( if not occasionally moronic
- exibit a
:
" days of thunder
"
)
, bu the reason he
' s not grat isnt because he
' s too technical
and caluclated
. his shots are perfectly executed
,
and leave nothing to tje imagination
,
and they
' re always making sure you
' re paying attention
. this isnt incredibly annoying
, anbd it reduces
" enemy of the state
" to a mechanical mishmash ofthe flashy images that never exp
and thte mind at any great depths
,
but still manage to entertain wihtout any real problems
. despite never actually becoming great
, it
' s never actually boring
and it
' s always intriguing
. watching teh government set
- up smith is endlessly fascinating
, anbd since we care about smith
' s likeable portagonist
, we are set
- up for a good two hours worth of toom clancy
- esque entertainment
. add the best big cast this side ofthe the annual woody allen film
( everyone ffrom gabriel byrne to dan
butler pop up for cameos
)
,
and ytou
' ve got a good old fashioned escapist drama which doesnt all the thinking for you so that you never have to actually question tje debte over peronal privacy
and so you cant follow will smith
' s plight without a minute
' s worth of boredom
.
