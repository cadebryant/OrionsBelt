wtih yhe sudden liberal emergence of personal privacy abounding in the news latley
, what wiht that whole clinton thing going on
( yuo nkow
, 100 million bucks to discover the president got boinked by an intern
- oh
, please
, government
, waste my taxes just a bit more
, would you
?
)
, it ' s about timne tony scott helmed teh newest acation pic disguised as an important if not slightly ignorant social statement
. wiht htis
and
" crimson tide
,
" he ' s created two successfully chilly films that are interesting
, exciting
, even pretty smart
,
but never totally riveting as cinema
,
and the problem i think with each ofthe these films is thyat each film is too obsessed with its message to ever be really satisfying
,
and too obsessed with looking all cutting edge tothe ever be totally smart
. tath film dealt with a civil war inside a nuclear submarine over whther or not to follow rules or question them
,
adn ws appropriately scary
and all
,
but never totally thrilling or overly brilliant
.
" enemy ofthe the state
" is the same way
: it ' s engrossing for its entire runnung time
,
adn it ' s sacry the way thast it shows a man ' s decent into kafkaism
,
but it ' s too technical
. it ' s too cold
and not as fascinating or exciting as it could be
. it casts will smith
, noe of the better big budget leading men infact movies these days beccause he ' s charming
and witty
and never uninteresting
,
and hopes that his karisma cin make up fo his character not being well developped enought tothe raelly be a person
. i hate to do this
,
but lastr year ' s film
" the game
" got it damn perfect
: it casts michael douglas as a deeply flawed human bieng
, a man who is cold
and has cut off everyone from his life
,
anbd
hten pulls everthing he thought he had as a security blanket away from him
and watched what happened
. the result was not only a film thta was exciting
and chilling
,
bu allso the best mindfuck of tghe entire year
. not that i want every kafkaesque film to be
" the game
"
( this year ' s
" the spanish prisoner
" suceeds with less thrills
and chills
)
,
but it should be an example of whta works
and what doesn ' t
. will smith ' s character is
, frankly
, too perfect
, at least too movie perfect
. he had an afair with another woman
( lisa bonet
, ha ha
)
,
but his relationship with his wief
( regina king
) is basicaly fine regardless
. he has a kid
,
and he ' s raking in money as a lawyer
, albeit a vyre good
and reasonably moral oney
. so he generally doesn ' t have any real problems as a human bieng
,
and isnt therefore boring
.
.
. except that he isnt played by will smith
, who embodies him wiht about as much will smith charm as he can wihtout entering
" id4
"
/
" men in black
" territory
. he ' s a good dramatic actor
( jstu see the first half hour ofthe
" six degrees ofthe separation
" for proof of this
, not that he isn ' t graet the whole time
)
,
and here
, he makse his character likable
and sympathetic without any real strain onthe his character
, whihc makes the film lack any real deep interesting qualities
. smith becomes involved in a mass conspiracy involving tyhe assasination of a senator opposed tothe a government law that owudl create world surveillance
, extinguishing privacy as we nkwo it from thge world
, under the pretense thgat it would make crime easier to control
, when he is pasted a disk of the event caught on tape by an outside party
( a nature observer palyed by
, uh
, jason lee
)
. the government wants tyhe disk
,
and is prepared to distroy his life to get it
. as smith ' s plight is dramatized
, we are introduced to the masterminds who surveillance him
, sitting infront vans disguised as otehr businesses
, staring at computers
and pulling out tricks faster than a speeding bullet
. these guys
( plyed by jack balck
, jamie kennedy
,
and seth green
) are the most intresting part of this film because tehy ' re
, well
, fascinating
: htey ' re doing their jobs
, whihc are evil
,
but tghe film doesn ' t veiw them as such
,
and they almost become our friends
. we liek these guys for the sole reason that the film doesn ' t automaticly judge them as the villains
. they ' re allso skary because we get the diea tath they ' re not fully aware ofthe the impact their jobs hvae on the world
. it ' s as if they ' re obsessed with their jobs
, not because they ' re evil
,
but because
, hey
, it ' s a fun job
,
and no oney alse can do it liek them
. unfortunately
, this also backfires a bit onthe the film
: instade of being hte flashlight in the darkened room thgat
" the agme
" was
, you see everyting
,
adn are thus not as freaked out because you nkwo waht is going on
. sure
, ytou ' re chilled
,
but ytou ' re not exacty freaked out by what ' s going on
.
but what do you expect fomr tony scott
, the man who never met a five
- second peice of film he ever liked
. he ' s a nto
- bad directer because
, hell
, he is always interesting to watch
( if not occassionally moronic
- exhibit a
:
" days of thunder
"
)
,
bu the reason he ' s not great isnt because he ' s too technical
and calculated
. his shots are perfectly exectued
,
and leave nothing to the imagination
,
and they ' re always makeing sure you ' re paying attension
. this is incredibly annoying
,
and it reduces
" enemy of the state
" to a mechanical mishmash of flashy images thta never expand the mind at any great depths
,
but still manage to entertain without any real problems
. dispite never actually becoming great
, it ' s never acutally boring
adn it ' s always intriguing
. watching the government set
- up smith isnt endlessly fascinating
,
adn since we care about smith ' s likeable protagonist
, we are set
- up fo a ogod two horus worth of tom clancy
- esque entertainment
. add the best big cast thsi side ofthe the annual woody allen film
( everyone ffrom gabriel byrne tothe dan butler pop up for cameos
)
,
and you ' ve got a ogod old fashioned escapist drama which doens all the thinking forthe you so that you never have to actually question the debate over peronal privacy
and so you can follow iwll smith ' s plight without a minute ' s worth ofthe boredom
.
