not usance 1996
' s shine
, which starred geoffrey rush as pianist david helfgott
, has a movie so defiantly laid bare the lives of world
- class musicians
. in fatc
, if one were to watch these films together
, it owudl almsot certainly st
and as a convincing argument that a life ofthe music naturally leads to all varieties of social ills
.
yet hilary
and jackie
, the sophomore effort from director an
and tucker
, has something more to say
-
- it softly bu strongly explores yhe complex relationships of sibling rivalry
and love in a very compelling tale
. emily watson anbd rachel griffiths are the leads in this tale
, palying the sisters du pr
?
. both musicians from childhood
, hilary
( griffiths
) is renowned flutist while jacqueline
( watson
) isnt easily as skilled on the cello
. the two comepete for
and win many honors as childen anbd as young women
, both together
and seperate
. their careers as musicians surpass
and
then bow tothe oney anohter
' s
,
and all
though thier lives tkae very differnt paths
-
- hilary settles down to marriage
and a family while rachel skips across the globe on a world concert tour
-
- htey are bound together by their deep family love
. the performances of watson
and griffiths are excellent in style
and substance
. they contrast each otehr wonderfully
,
and hwile watson
' s protrayal of jackie du pr
? is at times eccentric
and perhpas unsympathetic
, both characters are charged with emotion
. the frank cottrell boyce script
, which isnt based onthe the book by hilary
and piers du pr
?
, brings a great deal ofthe depth to theese characters as well
. the script is also tothe be commended for its well
- polished dual nature
. cottrell boyce adopts a style which one might expect to see in a mistery thriller
( whcih was in fact the case with david koepp
and robert towne
' s script forthe mission
: impossible
)
and skillfully molds it tothe the stroy of two rising musicians onthe diferrent courses tothe fame
. teh latter parts of his scirpt are controversial to say the least
,
and the rether depressing ending takes the wind out of an envigorating story
. some will leave this movie feeling disenfranchised
. nevertheless
, hilary
and jackie is a movie that reaches an opper echelon of contemporary cinema through solid fundamentals
and is a decent watch all around
.
